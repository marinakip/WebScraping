If using Python 3.x, may need to change print statements, and some other small things. Gazebo simulation is only for Ubuntu 16 and ROS Kinetic. Will not work with Ubuntu18 and ROS Melodic (already tested). Also only tested Gazebo simulator with Python 2.7.\nRelevant algorithms:\nRRT*:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1186\ni-Nash Trajectory-based multi-robot planning:  http://php.scripts.psu.edu/muz16/pdf/Zhu-Otte-ICRA14.pdf\ni-Nash Policy-based multi-robot planning:  http://php.scripts.psu.edu/muz16/pdf/DJ-MZ-AR-IFAC15.pdf\nBelow are some gifs as code was developed over time.\nFirst gif is RRT but for multiple robots, with UI allowing user to enter any number of robots and click the start point and destination point.\n\nNext 3 gifs are the iNash trajectory algorithm without the pathGeneration() or inter-robot collision checking yet; the difference between the three is the near_radius size, notice the difference in how many connections tend to form from a given vertex.\n  \nNext gif is iNash trajectory with non-optimal pathGeneration added. Still no inter-robot collision checking\n\nNext gif is iNash trajectory with optimal path chosen added. No inter-robot collision checking. Notice that without edges being added from new vertices TOWARDS the existing tree (as explained in the algorithm, this is to avoid directed cycles), the paths to select from are still limited, with any optimal options more likely to be minor differences towards the end of the path. Trees no longer displayed to more easily see the path choices. The blue path is the first path found. The orange paths are displaying a shorter path found later in time.\n\nFor a larger number of robots, we will want each robot to have a larger variety of paths. Not just in the number of possible paths, but the number of very different paths. This will increase likelihood of avoiding collisions. Attempt below was: once one path is found, enable the ability of adding edges in the reverse direction, so that more paths can end up at the goal. This requires checking for directed cycles before adding, and added too much computational complexity.\n\nHere is the first ""final"" algorithm, with no additions to the exact design in the paper (ignoring additions attempted in previous gif). First gif shows the tree, second one only displays paths. Inter-robot collision checking is now included. Paths do not display unless they have no inter-robot collision.\n\n\nFirst attempt at using an approximate-nearest and approximate-near searching algorithm resulted in very non-random and less-exploring tree structure:\n\nUsed a k-d tree structure and subtree-pruning (as explained conceptually at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/bioinfo-lectures/kdtrees.pdf, though I have some differences in my design) to improve computational complexity of near/nearest searching. Finding exact near/nearest, not approximate. Also improved pathGen computational complexity by storing previously calculated paths for given vertices. The two windows in the gif below show the speed differences real-time.\n\nTook the above optimized algorithm and incorporated sampling of the entire state space (4 states: x position, y position, x velocity, y velocity). The top plot shows x,y position, the second plot shows x position vs x velocity, the third plot shows y position vs y velocity. 2nd and 3rd plots only displaying path once found. Notice the difference in the way the tree looks in the position plot, with some portions overlapping - this is because of the extra dimensions - only the 2-D projection of the tree is overlapped, not the actual 4-D tree. Note this still does not include state dynamics. Tree edges are straight lines, not calculated trajectories, yet. The only dynamic constraint included currently is max velocity. Note many edges may not actually be feasible yet - for example, if the x value increases but the straight line has a negative velocity, this makes no sense.\n\nThe above algorithm was used, with dynamically-feasible locally-optimal trajectories calculated for the point-mass double-integrator problem for all edges. The solution is: Solve free-final-time bang-bang in 2 dimensions - position and velocity. Solve this twice, once for x and once for y. Keep the one that takes longer, and re-calculate the other as a fixed-final-time problem (""sub-bang-bang"" similar to bang-bang except not the max control input). The gif below displays the results. Straight edges for the paths are displayed with smaller lines, and the thicker lines are the feasible trajectories. Notice the trajectories have smoother curves, however they result in unnecessary swirling around and turning. This is because while position path may be going right, the discrete points may require a velocity in the reverse direction. This could be improved with biased-velocity sampling or some other procedure.\n\nBelow is a display of the 2-D simulation of the policy algorithm. Notice the fast-slow-fast-slow etc behavior, due to bang-bang control for a point-mass robot.\n\nBelow is the same simulation as above, but for one robot so that the velocity plots are easier to see and understand. Notice here there is a required large change in x position, so the algorithm decided to use a biased x velocity sampling where it is more likely for values to be positive. Notice also how there is still some oscillation in the y direction, since there is no y biasing.\n\nThe y oscillation issue is fixed via velocity biasing towards zero. When a goal is not far away in a given dimension, the velocity is biased to be near zero in that dimension. See below for improvements. Notice less oscillation.\n\nAlgorithm was edited so that each robot has dual-tree forming, meaning trees form from both the starting point and the goal point and they grow towards each other. This method is used in RRT and RRT* because it increases the speed at which a path is found; here, it is even more important because it increases the path variety, meaning that it increases the likelihood that a robot can find a path that does not collide with other robots. Below is a gif showing the slow-motion tree forming for a single robot.\n\nThis gif below displays for a single robot an example of increased path variety. The path in black is the first path chosen by the robot, then the next one chosen because it has a lower cost is grey. Note previously the changes would only occur close to the goalset, whereas now path differences can occur at any point along the path.\n\nThe gif below is similar to above, except instead of only displaying paths that the robot had chosen at some point in time, it displays all possible paths. Note these are only paths that are found in the split second between clicking the second grey point and the blue button, and yet it still found that many :)\n\nThis gif below displays the same thing, but for more robots so you can more easily see the reasoning for wanting more path variety.\n\nHere is a display of the same code but with only the chosen paths being displayed, and the robots moving along the chosen path.\n\nHere are some displays with a larger number of robots with more intersections, without paths being displayed, so that you can more easily see the actual robot movement and the lack of collisions.\n\n\nLinearity of computational complexity in relation to the number of robots was confirmed through an automation of 225 simulation cases, with data shown below.\n\n\n\nCreating a simulation with Gazebo could be the next step towards reality, with some difficulties; possibilities could be: the discrete-vertex path values to Gazebo to control i-robot or ardrone. There does not seem to be an easy method of sending continuous time commands, and we do not know the state model of the 3d robots. So, position commands may be simpler and may make more sense. However, without a powerful enough computer, Gazebo simulations are tough. This gif below, for example, is a recording on my computer of a simple 4-robot 4-pts procedure (simply commands ""move to point x, y"" for four points on repeat) designed by someone else. Note, my computer has an intel-i5-9400f CPU and a Radeon RX590 GPU, and was running VirtualBox Ubuntu16 with ~7GB dedicated to running VirtualBox, and below is the rate at which it displayed.\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/CodyMDillinger', 'info_list': ['594', 'C++', 'MIT license', 'Updated Mar 3, 2021', '4', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Feb 27, 2021', '51', 'C++', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Dec 12, 2020', '33', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 3, 2021', '1', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 16, 2021', '9', 'JavaScript', 'MIT license', 'Updated Mar 6, 2021', '11', 'Python', 'BSD-2-Clause license', 'Updated Feb 20, 2020', '34', 'C++', 'Updated Mar 5, 2021', '2', 'Java', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 16, 2020', '181', 'Rust', 'Updated Mar 4, 2021']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['Microsoft Applied Robotics Research Library\nLabanotation Suite\n\nAuthors: David Baumert, Zhaoyuan Ma, John Lee, Sven Pleyer, Takuya Kiyokawa, Katsushi Ikeuchi\nThis Labanotation Suite repository contains a robot gesture authoring system comprised of software tools, source code, simulation software and sample data that supports experimentation with the concepts presented in the paper Describing Upper-Body Motions Based on Labanotation for Learning-from-Observation Robots (International Journal of Computer Vision, December 2018).

We divide the problem into two subtasks, and two policies are proposed to tackle each of them,\nby combining the critic predictions and relevant domain knowledge.\nA Bayesian-based policy accounting for past action experience performs pushing to search for the target;\nonce the target is found, a classifier-based policy coordinates target-oriented pushing and grasping to grasp the target in clutter.\nThe motion critic and the classifier are trained in a self-supervised manner through robot-environment interactions.\nOur system achieves a 93% and 87% task success rate on each of the two subtasks in simulation and an 85% task success rate in real robot experiments on the whole problem,\nwhich outperforms several baselines by large margins.\n\n\nSystem Overview\n\nIf you find this code useful, please consider citing our work:\n@article{yang2020deep,\ntitle={A Deep Learning Approach to Grasping the Invisible},\nauthor={Yang, Yang and Liang, Hengyue and Choi, Changhyun},\njournal={IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters},\nvolume={5},\nnumber={2},\npages={2232--2239},\nyear={2020},\ndoi={10.1109/LRA.2020.2970622},\npublisher={IEEE}\n}\n\nDependencies\n- Ubuntu 16.04\n- Python 3\n- PyTorch 0.4\n\nThe file of the conda environment is environment.yml.

The simulator\noverrides the various HAL JNI classes used by the WPI libraries to communicate with the hardware and\nnetwork.\nThis project is in very early stages and is not currently released anywhere.\nCaveats\nSome caveats to running this simulator\n\nIt is Java only\nIt has been tested extensively with the Bit Buckets robot, but not really with other robots so if we don\'t need it, it hasn\'t been sim\'d.\nIt only supports CTRE and REV motors. I haven\'t added hooks for the regular PWM motors\nThe keyboard is configured to simulate two PS4 controllers, so an xbox controller will have wonky axis and button mappings\nIt\'s fragile. The way most of the JNIs are redefined only work if the JNI doesn\'t change. Any new release from WPI\ncould break the sim. I have a fix for this, but haven\'t finished updating all JNI sims.\n\nCode Modules\nRobot Test Code\nThere is a mentor-bot Robot project for testing simulator code.\n\n\n\nPath\nModule\n\n\n\n\n/mentor-bot\nA bot for mentors to test with, because mentors need to learn to robot as well\n\n\n\nSimulator Modules\nThere are three simulator modules. The main simulator module is where the bulk of the code is. The CTRE\nand REV modules contain JNI overrides for CTRE and REV motors.

This part is very much in initial stages.

This will\nensure you can use shuffleboard and outline viewer to view any network table entries\nAdd a test Sim class\nThe launch the sim, create a new Sim.java file in src/test/java/frc/robot/Sim.java\npackage frc.robot;\n\nimport frc.robot.simulator.SimMain;\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class Sim {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, IOException {\n        // start the sim\n        SimMain.main(args);\n    }\n}\n\nvscode launch.json changes\nFinally, you\'ll need to update your launch.json to add an additional simulator configuration:\n    {\n      ""type"": ""java"",\n      ""name"": ""Sim - local"",\n      ""request"": ""launch"",\n      ""mainClass"": ""frc.robot.Sim"",\n      ""vmArgs"": ""-Djava.library.path=build/tmp/jniExtractDir"",\n      ""env"": {\n        ""DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"": ""build/tmp/jniExtractDir"",\n        ""Path"": ""${env:Path};${workspaceFolder}\\\\build\\\\tmp/jniExtractDir""\n      }\n    }\nBuild it and Test it\nUse vs code to build the robot (and extract the network table native libraries into your build/ dir).\n\nSelect the debug view and the newly created SimMain - local configuration, and click play.\n\nNote You may have to run it twice. The first time it can\'t load native libraries, for some reason.

To use, run pynetworktables2js where you\'re serving your HTML files, include the frc-web-components.js file as a script in your HTML page, and wrap your HTML in a frc-dashboard tag, and you\'re ready to go!\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>My Robot Dashboard!</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <frc-dashboard>\n      <nt-string key=""/robotName"" value=""Dozer""></nt-string>\n      <nt-number key=""/angle"" value=""135""></nt-number>\n      <h1>\n        My robot\'s name is <frc-label source-key=""/robotName""></frc-label>\n      </h1>\n      <frc-differential-drivebase\n        source-key=""/LiveWindow/Ungrouped/DifferentialDrive[1]""\n      ></frc-differential-drivebase>\n      <frc-gyro source-key=""/angle"" precision=""2""></frc-gyro>\n    </frc-dashboard>\n    <script src=""./frc-web-components.js""></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nInstallation\n\nInstall pynetworktables2js\nDownload the frc-web-components.js file from the releases page and include it in your HTML dashboard.\n\n\nExamples\nUsage examples can be found here.\n\nHow to Use\nTo use wrap your HTML dashboard code in the <frc-dashboard></frc-dashboard> element. This will include the necessary code for your dashboard to run as well as asynchronously load the pynetworktables2js script in your page.\n\nUsing the NetworkTables API\nSince the script is loaded asynchronously, you\'ll need to use the frc-dashboard\'s onload event.\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <frc-dashboard onload=""ntLoaded()"">\n      <!-- Dashboard code goes here -->\n    </frc-dashboard>\n    <script src=""./frc-web-components.js""></script>\n    <script>\n      function ntLoaded() {\n        NetworkTables.addGlobalListener(function(key, value, isNew) {\n          // do something with the values as they change\n        }, true);\n\n        NetworkTables.putValue(\'/networktablesLoaded\', true);\n      }\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\nMore on the NetworkTables API can be found here: https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/projects/pynetworktables2js/en/stable/api_js.html\n\nUsing the components\nFRC Web Components are used by adding them inside the <frc-dashboard></frc-dashboard> component:\n<frc-dashboard onload=""ntLoaded()"">\n  <frc-number-bar></frc-number-bar>\n</frc-dashboard\n\nThey can be changed by setting their attributes:\n<frc-dashboard onload=""ntLoaded()"">\n  <frc-number-bar value=""2"" min=""-5"" max=""5""></frc-number-bar>\n</frc-dashboard\n\nYou can also set a component\'s attributes by giving it a NetworkTable key:\n<frc-dashboard onload=""ntLoaded()"">\n  <nt-number key=""/bar/value"" value=""3""></nt-number>\n  <nt-number key=""/bar/min"" value=""0""></nt-number>\n  <nt-number key=""/bar/max"" value=""10""></nt-number>\n  <!-- Here we pass the subtable ""/bar"" -->\n  <frc-number-bar source-key=""/bar""></frc-number-bar>\n  <!-- Here we pass the single NetworkTable entry ""/bar/value"" -->\n  <frc-number-bar source-key=""/bar/value""></frc-number-bar>\n</frc-dashboard>\n\nAbove we passed NetworkTable keys into two separate <frc-number-bar> components through the source-key attribute. If we pass in a subtable, all the subtable\'s entries will be mapped to the component\'s attributes. If we pass in a single entry, the component\'s primary attribute will be set, if it has one. In this case <frc-number-bar>\'s primary attribute is value.\nYou can also set a component\'s attributes through a mixture of NetworkTables and manually setting its attributes:\n<frc-dashboard onload=""ntLoaded()"">\n  <nt-number key=""/bar/value"" value=""3""></nt-number>\n  <nt-number key=""/bar/min"" value=""0""></nt-number>\n  <nt-number key=""/bar/max"" value=""10""></nt-number>\n\n  <frc-number-bar source-key=""/bar"" min=""-5"" precision=""4""></frc-number-bar>\n</frc-dashboard>\n\nAbove you may notice the component\'s min attribute took on the value passed in through NetworkTables. NetworkTables takes precedence and will override hard coded attribute values.\nAlso note that NetworkTable keys will always be converted to camelCase to match the attribute\'s properties. For example:\n<frc-dashboard onload=""ntLoaded()"">\n  <nt-number key=""/bar/.value"" value=""3""></nt-number>\n  <nt-number key=""/bar/Min"" value=""0""></nt-number>\n  <nt-number key=""/bar/ max "" value=""10""></nt-number>\n\n  <frc-number-bar source-key=""/bar"" min=""-5"" precision=""4""></frc-number-bar>\n</frc-dashboard>\nWill still display correctly:\n\nBecause of this conversion it\'s possible for name collisions to happen.\n<nt-number key=""/bar/.value"" value=""-1""></nt-number>\n<nt-number key=""/bar/Value"" value=""-.5""></nt-number>\n<nt-number key=""/bar/value"" value=""0""></nt-number>\n<nt-number key=""/bar/ value"" value="".5""></nt-number>\n\n<frc-number-bar source-key=""/bar/value""></frc-number-bar>\nAll of these will result in the same attribute being set. The attribute\'s value will be .5 since that was the last line executed.\n\nCreating Your Own Component\nThe list of FRC Web Components will continue being updated and expanded, but many teams will probably want to create their own for their custom dashboards. The frc-web-components.js file exposes a couple of modules for creating and registering components: webbit and webbitRegistry. The webbit module is used to define components and webbitRegistry is used to register them. Both these modules contain a number helper functions and classes used to create custom components, but these are the most commonly used ones:\n// These are the functions you need to define your component\nvar { Webbit, css, html } = webbit;\n\nclass MyComponentClass extends Webbit {\n\n  // This is the function needed to define properties, which automatically\n  // update the component when their values change. They also by default\n  // reflect their values in your component\'s attributes. That means when\n  // you change the name attribute in your component\'s HTML element,\n  // this.name will also change, and when you change this.name internally,\n  // the name attribute in your component\'s HTML element will also change.\n  static get properties() {\n    return {\n      name: { type: String, primary: true },\n      moodRating: { type: Number, attribute: \'mood-rating\' }\n    }\n  }\n\n  // This is the function needed to define the styles for your component.\n  // The css here only affects the HTML rendered in your component. CSS\n  // defined outside your component also doesn\'t affect your component\'s\n  // rendered HTML.\n  static get styles() {\n    return css`\n      p span {\n        color: green;\n      }\n    `;\n  }\n\n  // This is needed to initialize things in your component and set default\n  // property values.\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.name = \'Bob\';\n    this.moodRating = 8.5;\n  }\n\n  // This is the function needed to define the HTML your component renders\n  render() {\n    return html`\n      <p>Hello, my name is <span>${this.name}</span>!</p>\n      <p>My mood is a <span>${this.moodRating}/10</span> right now.</p>\n    `;\n  }\n}\n\n// This is the function you need to register your component\nwebbitRegistry.define(\'my-component\', MyComponentClass);\nCreate a file called my-component.js in the same folder as your index.html and frc-web-components.js, and add the above code to the file. Include the script below where you included the frc-web-components.js script in your index.html file:\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <frc-dashboard>\n      <my-component name=""Amory"" mood=""10""></my-component>\n    </frc-dashboard>\n    <script src=""./frc-web-components.js""></script>\n    <script src=""./my-component.js""></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\nYour webpage should now look like this:\n\nYou can also now connect your component to NetworkTables:\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <frc-dashboard>\n      <nt-string key=""/myComponent/name"" value=""Amory""></nt-string>\n      <nt-number key=""/myComponent/moodRating"" value=""10""></nt-number>\n      <my-component source-key=""/myComponent""></my-component>\n    </frc-dashboard>\n    <script src=""./frc-web-components.js""></script>\n    <script src=""./my-component.js""></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\nYour webpage should look the same:\n\n\nLitElement\nThe Webbit class itself extends LitElement, which is a library used to create custom components. There are some differences and gotchas, but if you know how to create components using LitElement, you know almost everything you need to create custom FRC components. To understand how LitElement works, look over the project\'s live examples, guide and API here: https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/\n\nCreating components examples and tutorials\nMore in-depth tutorials on how to create your own components will be added soon.

A detailed showcase of SquidCuber can found by clicking the image below:\n\nI started rewriting rob-twophase (the solving algorithm powering the machine at hand) some time at the end of last December, mostly to clean up the code but also to speed it up even more and include a few additional features.\nActual work on this robot only started in the beginning of January when I was messing around with Lego Technic to come up with a more stable (and elegant) construction.\nAbout three weeks later the model was standing and programming could start.\nAlthough SquidCuber of course strongly draws from the knowledge gained by working on prior robots for many months, there have been countless, seemingly subtle yet actually crucially important improvements.\nIf any single one of them was missing, the robot would not be able to get the times it does.\nFurthermore, I had to completely redesign the color recognition algorithm (as the extremely strong reflections completely broke all my previous approaches).\nWhile it is now quite a bit more complex (featuring full constraint propagation as well as a learning component), it does not just work leagues better but is also over 5 times faster.\nOverall, SquidCuber is a big step up over its predecessor.\nDetails\nSquidCuber consists of 12 motors joined pairwise (with up-gearing) to form much faster and stronger double-motors.\nEach of the 6 motor pairs is directly connected to one of the centers of the cube (to make that possible Lego bricks have been glued on the center caps, similarly to the modifactions done by most recent official Guinness World Record robots).\n2 parallel sides are powered by 1 of 3 Lego Mindstorm controllers each.\nThe general Lego construction built form ~1300 Technic bricks is designed to ensure maximum stability as well as precise centering of the cube (with respect to the motor connections), permitting much more aggressive turning without any loss of consistency.\n2 web-cams are precisely positioned in such a way that the can see 3 sides of the cube respectively, allowing the robot to scan the full starting state in a single ""look"".\nAs the cameras have really steep viewing angles onto the cube (and the cube\'s surface texture is not helping either), there are often very strong reflections on the plastic making correct scanning extremely challenging (requiring a highly advanced custom color matching algorithm).\nAlmost the entire control happens on the PC running Python scripts.\nIt communicates with the Mindstorm controllers (as well as the cameras) over USB via so called ""Direct Command"" (using Christoph Gaukel\'s fantastic ev3-python3 API), i.e. bit-pattern as accepted by the internal Mindstorm firmware.\nThis admmittedly rather inconvenient manner of programming is surprisingly critical to ensure minimum latency and utilization of the best motor drivers (the official Lego ones) giving signifcant speed-ups (in terms of actual solving performance) over any programming frameworks running in extra VMs.\nSolutions are computed using version 2.0 of my very own rob-twophase algorithm, an extremely efficient implementation of Herbert Kociemba\'s two-phase algorithm (written in C++) specifically designed for the use by ultra high-speed robots.\nIt is not just the fastest solver currently available online, but the only one that has the robot mechanics (i.e. that parallel faces can be turned at the same time and that 180 degree moves take twice as long as 90 degree ones) deeply built in and thus finds up to 20% faster solutions to execute on average.\nThe following is a list of (in my opinion) the most interesting features/optimizations employed by SquidCuber and where to find them:\n\nA highly robust color matching algorithm (scan/) able to consistently handle the very challenging scan conditions of this robot based on machine learning (scan/train.py) and full constraint propagation (scan/match.cpp).\nControl of a non-trivial robot with Lego Direct Commands, i.e. bit-patterns as accepted by the internal Mindstorm engine. (cmd.py)\nA movement system that heavily utilizes the corner cutting capabilities of a modern speed-cube by differentiating more than 20 different turn transition cases with meticulous individual tuning (control.py).\nDetermining optimal directions of 180 degree turns (which can always be executed either clockwise or counter-clockwise) with respect to the corner cutting (control.py).\nRating the multiple solutions return by the solver according to timing data collected during previous solves to select the overall fastest solution (control.py).\n\nPlease note that the code here focusses exclusively on the essentials, i.e. non-trivial techniques for reaching maximum speed while maintaining solid consistency, and thus does not include a pretty graphical user interface or a highly abstracted API.\nDisclaimer\nThis repository is primarily intended as a resource for people looking to learn some advanced tricks for speeding up their own solvers (and of course also people interested in the techniques underlying high-speed cube solvers in general).\nIt is not meant to provide software that can be run as is, hence also no building instructions for the hardware are included (there are other robot designs developed specifically for being rebuilt).\nI hope my work will inspire the development of many new cube robots! :)\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/efrantar', 'info_list': ['27', 'Python', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Feb 11, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 2, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 2, 2020', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', '4', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 29, 2020', 'PHP', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 22, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 25, 2020', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020']}","{'location': 'Clearwater, Florida, USA.', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '234 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/igoramidzic', 'info_list': ['27', 'Python', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Feb 11, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 2, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 2, 2020', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', '4', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 29, 2020', 'PHP', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 22, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 25, 2020', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '293 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/angelricardoh', 'info_list': ['27', 'Python', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Feb 11, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 2, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 2, 2020', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', '4', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 29, 2020', 'PHP', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 22, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 25, 2020', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '13 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['yale_robotics\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/msolonko', 'info_list': ['27', 'Python', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Feb 11, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 2, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 2, 2020', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', '4', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 29, 2020', 'PHP', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 22, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 25, 2020', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020']}","{'location': 'Ottawa, ON', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '948 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Tower Takeover 2019-2020\nThis project was created as part of the the VEX VRC Tower Takeover Competition in the 2019-2020 competition season.

Each if statement has its own conditions based off a variable called control, when each button is pressed, the value of control will be updated, and will determine which macro need be called.\nThe encoder values of the goofy arm were recorded at the specific heights designated for the small medium towers. The goofy arm is then moved until it reaches the prescribed encoder value.\n\nDue to the extreme weight of the goofy arm, the motors need to be running at a speed of 5rpm in order to keep  it still. Built-in functions, such as brake_mode are unable to balance the weight of the arm, so an opposing force is required.\n\nContributing\nTo contribute to this repository you should obviously be in 2381C.

EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!""(Any Dalek will say that)\n\nMotivation\nLet\'s imagine the following scenario: you need to retrieve a Post object from a REST API, something like:\nclass PostRepository {\n\n    suspend fun getPost(id: String): Post {\n        // async api call\n        // serialization\n        // error handling\n    }\n}\nIt\'s an asynchronous operation that can take a while to complete and can fail (TimeoutException, IOException, SerializationException...). But wait, there\'s more: you need to keep the UI updated so your user knows what\'s going on.\nThis is a nightmare, right? Calm down! Dalek is here to help 🤖\nUsage\n1. Wrap your code inside Dalek\nTo start using Dalek, you just need to wrap your existing code inside it.\nDalek will run your code inside a suspend fun and return a Flow<DalekEvent<T>>, where T is the output of your code (you can return null, Unit and Any, I won\'t judge you).\nclass MyViewModel(private val repository: PostRepository) : ViewModel() {\n\n    fun getPost(id: String): Flow<DalekEvent<Post>> =\n        Dalek(Dispatchers.IO) {\n            repository.getPost(id)\n        }\n}\n2. Handle the UI events\nDalek will emit the following events:\n\nStart: always emitted\nSuccess(value: T): only emitted when your code is successfully executed\nFailure(exception: Throwable): only emitted when an exception is thrown\nFinish: always emitted\n\nclass MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {\n\n    private fun loadPost(id: String) {\n        viewModel.getPost(id)\n            .collectIn(lifecycleScope) { event ->\n                when (event) {\n                    is Start -> setLoading(true)\n                    is Success -> showPost(event.value)\n                    is Failure -> showError(event.exception)\n                    is Finish -> setLoading(false)\n                }\n            }\n    }\n}\nImport to your project\n\nAdd the JitPack repository in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:\n\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n        maven { url \'https://jitpack.io\' }\n    }\n}\n\nNext, add the library to your module:\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation ""com.github.adrielcafe:dalek:$currentVersion""\n}\nCurrent version: \n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/adrielcafe', 'info_list': ['TeX', 'Updated Jan 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 27, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', '20', 'Kotlin', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 1, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 28, 2020', 'CMake', 'Updated Jan 26, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 15, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '0 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/212hawk', 'info_list': ['TeX', 'Updated Jan 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 27, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', '20', 'Kotlin', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 1, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 28, 2020', 'CMake', 'Updated Jan 26, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 15, 2020']}","{'location': 'Vienna', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '37 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/atis06', 'info_list': ['TeX', 'Updated Jan 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 27, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', '20', 'Kotlin', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 1, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 28, 2020', 'CMake', 'Updated Jan 26, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 15, 2020']}","{'location': 'Los Angeles, CA', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '20 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree Repo\nProject1 Build My World\nProject2 Go Chase It\nProject3 Where Am I\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/valen7zhi', 'info_list': ['TeX', 'Updated Jan 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 27, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', '20', 'Kotlin', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 1, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 28, 2020', 'CMake', 'Updated Jan 26, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 15, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '13 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/owen200090', 'info_list': ['TeX', 'Updated Jan 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 27, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', '20', 'Kotlin', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 1, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 28, 2020', 'CMake', 'Updated Jan 26, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 15, 2020']}"

Both use base classes from BaseSLAM library.\nCoreSLAM\nThis is based on the CoreSLAM algorithm by Bruno Steux, Oussama El Hamzaoui (I can\'t find an authentic link to it...).\nThe Monte-carlo search function has been looked from some other C and C++ implementations but I did differently.\nFirst of all there\'s always fixed number of iterations to get stable speed.\nAdditionally the search is done on multiple threads to get maximum performance on multi-core platform.\nIt also uses Redzen fast normal distribution random number generator and the trick is to pre-calculate random numbers. So when it\'s time do localization, the right amount of random numbers are ready to use.\nI used it in my Robotex 2019 robotic competition robot ""Ace Ventura"" and won the ""Starship animal rescure"" competition, so it kind of works.\nIt ran on Raspberry Pi 4 using .NET Core 3.0 and there was some CPU time left over for other tasks also. But now the code is for .NET 5.0.\nMy problem with this SLAM algorithm was that even with wheel odometry the map tilted and slided over time.\nHowever, it may have been just a configuration issue and for that reason I created a simulation application to quickly try out different parameters (hole width, etc.).\nHere\'s the picture of the CoreSLAM functioning in simulation:\n\nThe grayscale map is the hole map. Blue edges are true walls. Blue circle is true position, red is estimated position.\nWhen you compile and run simulation, use left mouse button to drag the real position and see how the hole map estimator works.\nIf you click further than SigmaXY the estimator may fail to find correct position.\nThere is artificial noise added to the ""lidar"" measurements.\nParameters tuning is in the code, no UI features for that.\nThe lidar ray tracing is done with .NET variant of Box2D.\nHectorSLAM\nThis is the port of HectorSLAM algorithm from C++ to C#.\nHectorSLAM is originally a ROS package and based on what I\'ve read and seen it looks much more stable than CoreSLAM.\nSince I\'m not very fond of C++ boilerplate code (getters and setters) I started porting it and actually it went much smaller in lines of code.\nActually there\'s quite a bit of unused functions also, so it\'s possible to strip it down even further.\nThe code uses .NET System.Numerics namespace so there\'s no external dependency.\nIn the simulator it works fine as long as the robot (mouse cursor) movement speed per lidar scan is less than the physical pixels size of coarsest map.\nE.g. if the resolution is 0.05m, map size is 400x400, map levels is 3, scan rate is 7 scans/sec then max speed must be:\n(400 * 0.05m) / 23 => 2.5 m/scan => 0,35 m/s.\nI haven\'t yet tried in real world.\nHere\'s the picture of the HectorSLAM functioning in simulation:\n\n\nPS.\nYou can get the RPLidar A1 C# code from here. To do path planning, you can use my fork of Roy-T AStar.

We present a framework to automatically generate arbitrary complex virtual fixtures for any geometries given a polygon mesh (STL) file. The framework is integrated with core CISST-SAW libraries, thus supports all CISST-based robots with a few lines of change, including but not limited to dVRK and UR. To apply virtual fixture to your robot, there are very few lines needed to change in your control code. This repo contains an interactive demo as well as example code of the virtual fixture working with dVRK.\n\n\n\nPresentation is available on YouTube:\n\nIf you find our work relevant, please cite\n@article{li2020anatomical,\n  title={Anatomical Mesh-Based Virtual Fixtures for Surgical Robots},\n  author={Li, Zhaoshuo and Gordon, Alex and Looi, Thomas and Drake, James and Forrest, Christopher and Taylor, Russell H},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.02415},\n  year={2020}\n}\n\nTable of Content\n\nSystem Requirement\nDependencies\nCompilation\nDemo\n\nVisualization\nInteractive Demo\ndVRK\nSimulated dVRK\n\n\nLog\nAcknowledgement\n\nSystem Requirement\nWe have tested the code functionality on Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and 20.04.\nDependencies\n\n3D Slicer: We use 3D Slicer as a front end for visualization.

In 2018, across the world there were 315 natural disaster events recorded with 11,804 deaths, over 68 millions of people were affected, and 131.7 billion dollars in economic losses.\nAfter a disaster strikes, governments and private organizations engage in reconstruction efforts of infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, power and railway lines, houses etc. This is a very labor and capital-intensive task. Moreover, doing this at a disaster site, with its multiple associated risks and challenging terrain, poses an additional challenge.\nMotivated by this scenario, in order to help the needy victims in the affected areas, this edition of e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC 2019-20) presents the theme Contruct-o-Bot.\nIn this theme, the arena is an abstraction of a disaster site where the robot picks the construction material and traverses paths in order to deposit it at the site to be reconstructed. In order to maneuver over these paths, the Construct-O-Bot has to use intelligent line-following and path-planning algorithms to reach safely and quickly using shortest paths.\nAfter reaching the site, the Construct-O-Bot carefully has to place the material at the required positions which may include placing the material at different heights from the ground. It has to deposit all required material at multiple construction sites, navigating through various terrains.\nThe team that finishes the given task in the least amount of time whilst incurring the least penalties will be declared the winner.\nResults\nTask 0\n\nRemark : Visual Studio Installed and V_REP Installed\nPassed\nTask 1.1\n95/100\n\nRemark : Good Work\nTask 1.2\n88/100\n\nRemark : You have picked 7 and placed 2\nTask 2\nRemark : Good\nTask 3\n88/100\n\nRemark : Good Work\nTask 4\n433/380 (30% bonus for early submission)\n\nRemark : Good work, Make your arm sturdy.\nTask 5\nOriginal Configuration: 1494\nBonus Configuration: 1315\nCode: 50\nTotal = 1494 + (1315*0.33) + 50 = 1982\n\nRemark : Original Configuration: Had penalty and missed one pick and drop\nDemo\nHardware Testing\nhttps://youtu.be/kqlR-GdEUJE\nRobot Testing\nhttps://youtu.be/lDrcOotHkA0\nTask 4\nhttps://youtu.be/vr7ZOj5xuTk\nhttps://youtu.be/OVagyDxdAV0\nTask 5\nOriginal Configuration\nhttps://youtu.be/pC9cgT4azlI\nBonus Configuration\nhttps://youtu.be/SYDLNNLTBhI\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/LiquidatorCoder', 'info_list': ['15', 'C++', 'Updated Nov 16, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 27, 2020', '4', 'C', 'Updated Mar 10, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 20, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 25, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 25, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 25, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 26, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 26, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '10 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': [""Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Introducing GitHub\nWelcome to your repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course.

It provides multiple control modes, and hides the complexity of changing between these modes.\nThis package extends the RV Manipulation Driver package.\nUsage\nLaunching the driver\nThe Panda Driver is launched by:\nroslaunch rv_panda_driver robot_bringup.launch\nWhen starting up the Panda robot:\n\nThe lights indicate the status of the robot.\n\nBlue = happy and ready to move\nWhite = happy but E-stopped\nYellow = error\n\n\nYou will need to release the joint locks through the Franka interface\nWhen operating the arm have the E-stop handy for safety at all times\nWhen the arm is E-stopped the robot can be moved freely using the wrist switch\n\nTo ensure the arm is working once started you can invoke the home service.\nrosservice call /arm/home\nMoving the arm\nThe Panda Driver provides a number of options for moving the robot arm. These include moving to fixed poses, as well as moving the arm by specifiying Cartesian velocities for the end-effector.\nMoving the End-Effector to an Arbitrary Pose\nThe following code example moves the robot end-effector to an arbitrary position and orientation w.r.t. to the robot\'s base frame.\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\n\nimport rospy\nimport actionlib\n\nfrom rv_msgs.msg import MoveToPoseAction, MoveToPoseGoal\nfrom geometry_msgs.msg import PoseStamped\n\n# initialise ros node\nrospy.init_node(\'move_to_points_example\')\n\n# Create a ros action client to communicate with the driver\nclient = actionlib.SimpleActionClient(\'/arm/cartesian/pose\', MoveToPoseAction)\nclient.wait_for_server()\n\n# Create a target pose\ntarget = PoseStamped()\ntarget.header.frame_id = \'panda_link0\'\n\n# Populate with target position/orientation (READY POSE)\ntarget.pose.position.x = 0.307\ntarget.pose.position.y = 0.000\ntarget.pose.position.z = 0.590\n\ntarget.pose.orientation.x = -1.00\ntarget.pose.orientation.y =  0.00\ntarget.pose.orientation.z =  0.00\ntarget.pose.orientation.w =  0.00\n\n# Create goal from target pose\ngoal = MoveToPoseGoal(goal_pose=target)\n\n# Send goal and wait for it to finish\nclient.send_goal(goal)\nclient.wait_for_result()\nServoing the End-Effector to an Arbitrary Pose\nThe following code example servos the robot end-effector to an arbitrary position and orientation w.r.t. to the robot\'s base frame.\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\n\nimport rospy\nimport actionlib\n\nfrom rv_msgs.msg import ServoToPoseAction, ServoToPoseGoal\nfrom geometry_msgs.msg import PoseStamped\n\n# initialise ros node\nrospy.init_node(\'servo_to_points_example\')\n\n# Create a ros action client to communicate with the driver\nclient = actionlib.SimpleActionClient(\'/arm/cartesian/servo_pose\', ServoToPoseAction)\nclient.wait_for_server()\n\n# Create a target pose\ntarget = PoseStamped()\ntarget.header.frame_id = \'panda_link0\'\n\n# Populate with target position/orientation (READY POSE)\ntarget.pose.position.x = 0.307\ntarget.pose.position.y = 0.000\ntarget.pose.position.z = 0.590\n\ntarget.pose.orientation.x = -1.00\ntarget.pose.orientation.y =  0.00\ntarget.pose.orientation.z =  0.00\ntarget.pose.orientation.w =  0.00\n\n# Create goal from target pose\ngoal = ServoToPoseGoal(stamped_pose=target, scaling=0.5)\n\n# Send goal and wait for it to finish\nclient.send_goal(goal)\nclient.wait_for_result()\nControlling End-Effector Cartesian Velocity\nThe following code example moves the robot end-effector at 2cm/s in the z-axis w.r.t. robot\'s base-frame for a total of 5 seconds. For safety reasons the driver has an expected minimum update frequency of 100Hz.\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\n\nimport rospy\nimport timeit\nfrom geometry_msgs.msg import TwistStamped\n\n# initialise ros node\nrospy.init_node(\'cartesian_motion\')\n\n# Create the publisher (queue size tells ROS to only publish\n# the latest message)\npublisher = rospy.Publisher(\'/arm/cartesian/velocity\', TwistStamped, queue_size=1)\n\n# Create an initial start time\nstart_timer = timeit.default_timer()\n\n# Create a velocity message that will instruct the robot to\n# move at 2cm a second in the z-axis of the base frame.\nvelocity = TwistStamped()\nvelocity.twist.linear.z = 0.02\n\n# Publish the velocity message to the Panda driver at a\n# frequency of 100Hz\nwhile (timeit.default_timer() - start_timer) < 5:\n  publisher.publish(velocity)\n  rospy.sleep(0.01)\n \n# Publish an empty TwistStamped to ensure that the arm stops moving\npublisher.publish(TwistStamped())\nNamed Joint Configurations\nIn applications we typically define a number of task specific configurations, and it is convienent if these can be assigned names.\nWhile the MoveIt framework provide the ability to store joint configurations (called named poses), these must be defined in the MoveIt configuration of the robot and cannot be adjusted during operation.\nThe Panda Driver solves this issue by providing the ability to save and remember joint configurations of the Panda robot for future use, while also providing access to named poses provided by MoveIt.\nSaving Named Poses\nTo save the current joint configuration of the robot with the name test_pose:\nrosservice call /arm/set_named_pose ""pose_name: \'test_pose\' overwrite: false""\n\nGetting Named Poses\nTo get the set of currently stored named joint configurations (created either through the driver or MoveIt)\nrosservice call /arm/get_named_poses\nMoving to a Named Pose\nTo move to a named named joint configuration:\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\n\nimport rospy\nimport actionlib\n\nfrom rv_msgs.msg import MoveToNamedPoseAction, MoveToNamedPoseGoal\n\n# initialise ros node\nrospy.init_node(\'named_pose_example\')\n\n# Create a ros action client to communicate with the driver\nclient = actionlib.SimpleActionClient(\'/arm/cartesian/named_pose\', MoveToNamedPoseAction)\nclient.wait_for_server()\n\n# Create and send a goal to move to the named pose test_pose\nclient.send_goal(MoveToNamedPoseGoal(pose_name=\'test_pose\'))\nclient.wait_for_result()\nNote: The goal pose can be a named pose created either by the driver or MoveIt. However, the named poses provided by the driver will take priority in the event of a naming conflict.\nSubscribed Topics\n\n\n/arm/cartesian/velocity (geometry_msgs/TwistStamped)\nMoves the end-effector in Cartesian space w.r.t. the target frame_id (base frame if no frame_id is set).\n\n\n/arm/joint/velocity (rv_msgs/JointVelocity)\nMoves the joints of the manipulator at the requested velocity.\n\n\nPublished Topics\n\n/arm/state  (rv_msgs/ManipulatorState)\nProvides information on the current state of the manipulator including the pose of the end-effector w.r.t. to the base link, whether the manipulator is experiencing a Cartesian contact and collision as a bit-wised error state flag.\n\nServices\n\n\n/arm/home (std_srvs/Empty)\nMoves the robot back to its initial ready pose.\n\n\n/arm/recover (std_srvs/Empty)\nRecovers from collision or limit violation error states that will put the robot into a non-operable state.\n\n\n/arm/stop (std_srvs/Empty)\nStops the current motion of the current.\n\n\n/arm/set_ee_offset (rv_msgs/SetPose)\nSets the offset between the end-effector and the wrist of the robot arm.\n\n\n/arm/get_named_poses (rv_msgs/GetNamesList)\nGets a list of currently stored named poses (includes both MoveIt and driver stored named poses).\n\n\n/arm/set_named_pose (rv_msgs/SetNamedPose)\nSaves the current joint configuration of the robot with the provided pose name.\n\n\n/arm/set_cartesian_impedance (rv_msgs/SetCartesianImpedance\nAdjusts the impedenace of the end-effector position in Cartesian space.\n\n\n/arm/get_link_position (rv_msgs/GetRelativePose)\nA convenience wrapper around the ROS transform lookup service that provides the relative pose of a target frame w.r.t. a reference frame.\n\n\n/arm/set_cartesian_planning_enabled (std_srvs/SetBool)\nForces the path-planner to only consider linear paths when moving moving between poses with /arm/cartesian/pose\n\n\n/arm/get_cartesian_planning_enabled (rv_msgs/SimpleRequest)\nChecks whether the path-planner will only consider linear paths when moving moving between poses with /arm/cartesian/pose\n\n\n/arm/add_named_pose_config (rv_msgs/SetNamedPoseConfig)\nInstructs the driver to load named poses stored in the indicated config file.\n\n\n/arm/get_named_pose_configs (rv_msgs/GetNamedPoseConfigs)\nGets the list of config files to check for named poses.\n\n\n/arm/remove_named_pose_config (rv_msgs/SetNamedPoseConfig)\nInstructs the driver to remove named poses stored in the indicated config file.\n\n\nAction API\n\n\n/arm/cartesian/pose (rv_msgs/MoveToPose.action)\nMoves the end-effector to the requested goal pose w.r.t. the indicated frame id.\n\n\n/arm/cartesian/servo_pose (rv_msgs/ServoToPose.action)\nServos the end-effector to the requested goal pose.\n\n\n/arm/cartesian/named_pose (rv_msgs/MoveToNamedPose.action)\nMoves the end-effector to a pre-defined joint configuration.\n\n\n/arm/cartesian/servo_pose (rv_msgs/MoveToJointPoseAction)\nMoves the joints of the robot to the indicated positions (radians).\n\n\n/arm/gripper (rv_msgs/ActuateGripper.action)\nActuates the gripper based on the requested mode.

Further information will follow shortly.\nInstallation\nThe source code of RobotRSS is Open Source and openly accessible and editable. If you would like to use your own bot as newsfeed reader, you will find everything you need to install it here. It is recommended to run the bot in a docker container. You can find the latest, stable Docker Image on Dockerhub. If you make changes to the source code, you can easily create a new image of your version using the dockerfile located in the project folder.\nCreate a credentials file\nFirst, you must tell RobotRSS which bot the service is allowed to communicate with. Create a new telegram bot or use an existing one. All you need is the Bot\'s Token from Telegram. You can receive one from Telegrams Botfather.\nEdit the sample-credentials.json file located at /resources/sample-credentials.json.\n{\n  ""telegram_token"": ""INSERT TOKEN"",\n  ""update_interval"": 300\n}\nInsert your token and safe the file as credentials.json at /resources/credentials.json!\nInstall Dependencies using pip\nYou can easily install all needed Dependencies using pip. Navigate into the project directory and run pip install -r requirements.txt. If you prefer installing all Dependencies manually you can find a detailed list of all needed packages at the ""Dependencies"" Section at the bottom of the page.\nCreate a Docker Image\nYou can easily run RobotRSS inside a Docker Container. The Dockerfile can be found in the project directory. Run docker build --tag ""RobotRSS:latest"" . to create a new Docker Image based on the current code.\nYou can also pull the latest image from Dockerhub using docker pull cynthek/RobotRSS:latest.\nTo start your docker container use the following commands, passing BOT_TOKEN and optional UPDATE_INTERVAL environment variable to the container:\ndocker run -itd --name ""your-container-name"" -e BOT_TOKEN=""Enter your token"" robotrss:latest\n# or use\ndocker run -itd --name ""your-container-name"" -e BOT_TOKEN=""Enter your token"" -e UPDATE_INTERVAL=<Number in Minutes> robotrss:latest\nUPDATE_INTERVAL is set to 300 per default, updating feeds of subscribers every 5 minutes (300 sec).\nPython Version\nRobotRSS has been successfully tested with Python 2.7

Robots).\nThe Story:\nThe 1 Martian Way RoboTeamX Chess Robots (RCR) were invented by Karan Kamdar while he was getting his Masters' Degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of California, Irvine.\nKaran started from a small dorm room with the fantastic dream of building a large scale chess set and autonomous distributed intelligence which would rival any human team.\nKaran sold his vision to Mr. Peter Shikli, CEO of Bizware Applications who was running a chess company called as MegaChess which sold large scale chess pieces. After that it was like a match made in heaven with Karan working day in and day out to build the entire team of robots and the chess board in the basement of Mr. Shikli's house in San Clemente, California. Peter got in the deals and funded the project while Karan solved a host of technical issues.\nThe RCR debuted at the Discovery Science Center in Orange County, CA on August 15th, 2009 and beat a team of humans in their very first game. It made several appearances at major places and theme parks such as LegoLand California creating quite a buzz in the country. It was also covered widely by the media with CBS and Orange County Register making first hand videos of the Bots in action. The story has also been published across various digital media channels, online blogs and websites alike.\nSince then RCR has been acquired as a brand by 1 Martian Way Corporation (1MW), a drones and robotics business in Mumbai, India.\nThe source code was officially made open source on 26th Jan, 2020.\nKey Feature:\nThe robots operate as a team and the complexity of computation is distributed amongst them i.e. the chess engine itself along with all other supporting computation and algorithms are distributed among the robots. The robots communicate in the form of a mesh network wirelessly constantly making sure that the integrity of data sent and received is correct. The idea is to use the chess game as a gamified platform to demonstrate how teams of robots can tackle a host of challenging tasks in different environments.\nVideos from TV Media:\nhttps://youtu.be/vZvZ8Fo9TGc\nhttps://youtu.be/mp0dxrH3pf4\nhttps://youtu.be/mgiYL3ZvSp8\nFuture Work:\nThe initial foundation and demonstration of our team of autonomous chess playing robots has been done and now the idea is to make it even more sophisticated and intelligent to compete against a team of human players.\nWe invite everyone who's interested in this project to learn about it and contribute to it.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/1-Martian-Way', 'info_list': ['Python', 'MPL-2.0 license', 'Updated Jan 21, 2020', 'Updated Jan 27, 2020', '1', 'HTML', 'Updated Mar 16, 2020', 'Updated Jan 22, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 22, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 19, 2021', 'Updated Jan 26, 2020', 'Updated Mar 4, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 26, 2020', 'Processing', 'Updated Jan 30, 2020']}"

robot\nIt all started when I was talking to my 4-year-old son in early October, 2019 about the coming Halloween.\nWe were talking about robots and candies, and it struck me -- wouldn\'t it be nice to have a robot that\nhands you candy when you say ""Trick-Or-Treat""?!\nI talked to my colleage Paul Davis who is quite crafty and googled a whole bunch.\nLong story short, we came up with this Pumpkin Robot.\nCheck out TOT_video.mp4 to see it in action.\n\nHardware\nSince I wanted speech recognition, I chose RaspberryPi, and an external microphone.\nIn the end, the speech recognition took longer than most children\'s patience allowed,\nI turned it off and just used a push button.\nSo RPi could be an overkill.\nThe candy dispenser mechanism is inspired by the Jelly Bean BeanBoozled Mystery Bean Jelly Bean Dispenser.\nWe used a cut-off juice box as a bowl to hold candies, a PVC pipe to push up the candy, and a servo to pull the PVC pipe.\nWhen the bowl is full of candies, the servo doesn\'t have enough torqque,\nso we added a short piece of rubber band just to help it out.\n\nSoftware\nYou\'ll need the GPIO package, and the pinout command will show you the GPIO numbers on your RPi.\nServo\nUse turn_servo.py to test your servo. I played around with the range, pause time and steps to get what I want.\nFor more detail on how to set up a servo on RPi, see this article.\nButton\nSee push_button.py. When pushed, the button will trigger the servo to lift the PVC pipe and\npush up a (occasionally 2) piece of candy.\nSee this article for how to connect your button.\nLED light\nThis is an optional add on, though proved to be quite practical during the Halloween night.\nIt turns the light on when the servo is ready.\nUse test_led.pyto test your light.\nSpeech recognition\nI followed this article to set up the ""Trick or Treat"" recognition.\nIf you see error messages from ALSA, you can safely ignore it according to this article.\nIn a quiet room, when I speak loud and clear, it works well.\nHowever, most of the time, it doesn\'t get it right.\nI tried to loose the matching to a list of options, but eventually decided to set it such that whatever you say,\nit will trigger the servo.\nSee tot_recognize.py for my code.\nOn the Halloween night, after a few kids, I had to unplugged the mic because most kids, though interested in the robot,\nare not interested enough to wait for a couple of seconds for their candy (so many houses to hit!).\nPushing a button and see the candy coming up was sufficiently intriguing.\nAuto run on RPi starts\nI used crontab -e and added the push_button.py to run automatically when RPi starts.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/YiouZuo', 'info_list': ['Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 27, 2020', 'Lua', 'Updated Jan 25, 2020', '1', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 25, 2020', 'C', 'Updated Apr 16, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 11, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Jan 22, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 21, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 14, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020']}"

Sourcing an overlay in the same terminal where you built, or likewise building where an overlay is sourced, may create complex issues.\nIn the new terminal, source your main ROS 2 environment as the “underlay”, so you can build the overlay “on top of” it:\nsource /opt/ros/eloquent/setup.bash\nGo into the root of your workspace:\ncd dev_ws\nIn the root, source your overlay:\nsource install/local_setup.bash\nSummary\nIn this tutorial, you sourced your main ROS 2 distro install as your underlay, and created an overlay by cloning and building packages in a new workspace. The overlay gets prepended to the path, and takes precedence over the underlay, as you saw with your modified turtlesim.\nUsing overlays is recommended for working on a small number of packages, so you don’t have to put everything in the same workspace and rebuild a huge workspace on every iteration.\nCreate a simple robot controller package\nCreate a package\nFirst, source your ROS 2 installation.\nLet’s use the workspace you created in the previous tutorial, dev_ws, for your new package.\nMake sure you are in the src folder before running the package creation command.\ncd ~/dev_ws/src\nCreate a new Python package with the name simple_controller and the node (executable) simple_controller_node:\nros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --node-name simple_controller_node simple_controller\nYou will now have a new folder within your workspace’s src directory called simple_controller.\nAfter running the command, your terminal will return the message:\ngoing to create a new package\npackage name: simple_controller\ndestination directory: /home/lars/dev_ws/src\npackage format: 3\nversion: 0.0.0\ndescription: TODO: Package description\nmaintainer: ['<name> <email>']\nlicenses: ['TODO: License declaration']\nbuild type: ament_python\ndependencies: []\nnode_name: simple_controller_node\ncreating folder ./simple_controller\ncreating ./simple_controller/package.xml\ncreating source folder\ncreating folder ./simple_controller/simple_controller\ncreating ./simple_controller/setup.py\ncreating ./simple_controller/setup.cfg\ncreating folder ./simple_controller/resource\ncreating ./simple_controller/resource/simple_controller\ncreating ./simple_controller/simple_controller/__init__.py\ncreating folder ./simple_controller/test\ncreating ./simple_controller/test/test_copyright.py\ncreating ./simple_controller/test/test_flake8.py\ncreating ./simple_controller/test/test_pep257.py\ncreating ./simple_controller/simple_controller/simple_controller_node.py\nBuild your package\nPutting packages in a workspace is especially valuable because you can build many packages at once by running colcon build in the workspace root. Otherwise, you would have to build each package individually.\nReturn to the root of your workspace:\ncd ~/dev_ws\nNow you can build your packages:\ncolcon build --symlink-install\nTo build only the simple_controller package next time, you can run:\ncolcon build --packages-select simple_controller\nSource the setup file\nTo use your new package and executable, first open a new terminal and source your main ROS 2 installation.\nThen, from inside the dev_ws directory, run the following command to source your workspace:\nsource install/setup.bash\nNow that your workspace has been added to your path, you will be able to use your new package’s executables.\nUse the package\nTo run the executable you created using the --node-name argument during package creation, enter the command:\nros2 run simple_controller simple_controller_node\n\nSummary\nYou’ve created the simple_controller ROS2 package to organize your code and make it easy to use for others.\nWriting a simple robot controller\nIn this tutorial, you will create a node that receives the state of the robot over a topic, and sends a command back to the robot driver on another topic.\nNavigate into ~/dev_ws/src/simple_controller/simple_controller:\ncd ~/dev_ws/src/simple_controller/simple_controller\nNow there will be a new file named simple_controller_node.py adjacent to __init__.py.\nOpen the file using your preferred text editor, remove the code that is already there, and copy in the following:\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\nfrom copy import copy\n\nimport rclpy\nfrom rclpy.node import Node\nfrom sensor_msgs.msg import JointState\nfrom control_interfaces.msg import PositionCommand\n\n\nclass SimpleControllerNode(Node):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__('simple_robot_controller')\n        self._pub = self.create_publisher(PositionCommand, 'command', 10)\n        self._sub = self.create_subscription(\n            JointState, 'joint_states', self._callback, 10)\n\n        self._t0 = None\n        self._initial_position = None\n\n    def _callback(self, msg):\n        if self._t0 is None:\n            self._t0 = time.time()\n            self._initial_position = copy(msg.position)\n\n        command_msg = PositionCommand()\n        command_msg.command = copy(msg.position)\n\n        correction = 0.1 * (np.sin(3.0 * (time.time() - self._t0)))\n        command_msg.command[0] = self._initial_position[0] + correction\n\n        self._pub.publish(command_msg)\n\n\ndef main(args=None):\n    rclpy.init(args=args)\n\n    simple_controller_node = SimpleControllerNode()\n    rclpy.spin(simple_controller_node)\n    \n    simple_controller_node.destroy_node()\n    rclpy.shutdown()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\nExamine the code\nThe first lines of code import the relevant modules from the Python installation:\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\nfrom copy import copy\nThen, we import rclpy so its Node class can be used.\nimport rclpy\nfrom rclpy.node import Node\nThe next statement imports the message types JointState and PositionCommand that the node uses to subscribe and publish on topics.\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\nfrom copy import copy\nNext, the SimpleControllerNode class is created, which inherits from (or is a subclass of) Node.\nclass SimpleControllerNode(Node):\nFollowing is the definition of the class’s constructor. super().init calls the Node class’s constructor and gives it your node name, in this case 'simple_robot_controller'.\ncreate_publisher declares that the node publishes messages of type PositionCommand (imported from the control_interfaces.msg module), over a topic named command, and that the “queue size” is 10. Queue size is a required QoS (quality of service) setting that limits the amount of queued messages if a subscriber is not receiving them fast enough.\nself._pub = self.create_publisher(PositionCommand, 'command', 10)\ncreate_subscriber declares that the node subscribes to messages of type JointState on the topic joint_states. Each time we receive a new message on this topic the callback function _callback is called.\nself._sub = self.create_subscription(\n    JointState, 'joint_states', self._callback, 10)\nThe callback function stores the time we received the first message, as well as the initial position of the robot.
