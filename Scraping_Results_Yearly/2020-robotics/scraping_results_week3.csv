At some point, the housekeeping will then be pushed back into the Github Action; I may also create another Github Action, or extend the original one, to perform the above steps to publish the release container.\nA proper tagging strategy and automation route for images creating and publishing images released to students also needs figuring out.\nQuick start (presentation testing)\nDownload and installer docker...\nFrom the command line / Powershell, run:\n# update the image\ndocker pull ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm129:current\n\nCreate a directory to share into the container somewhere, eg ~/TM129VCE\nDocker dashboard instructions\nFrom the images tab, create a new container (tm129vce), use port: 8129, select the TM129VCE directory you want to to share and mount it onto /home/jovyan/shared inside the container:\n\nSet the container running and follow the running containe\'s Open in browser dashboard link.\nGo to the With the container running instructions...\nMac instructions:\nIf you\'ve done the Docker Dashbboard route, follow the previous instruction and go to the With the container running section.\nFrom command line:\nFind yourself a working directory.\nOptionally create a TM129VCE test directory (one will be created if you don’t)\nRun:\n# update the image\ndocker pull ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm129:current\n# clear any old container\ndocker rm -f tm129vce\n# launch new container\ndocker run -d -p 8129:8888 --name tm129vce -v ""$PWD/TM129VCE"":/home/jovyan/shared  ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm129:current\n\nGo to the With the container running instructions...\nWindows instructions:\nIf you\'ve done the Docker Dashbboard route, follow the previous instruction and go to the With the container running section.\nUsing Powershell, find yourself a working directory.\nOptionally create a TM129VCE test directory (one will be created if you don’t)\nRun:\n# update the image\ndocker pull ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm129:current\n# clear any old container\ndocker rm -f tm129vce\n# launch new container\ndocker run -d -p 8129:8888 --name tm129vce -v $pwd\\TM129VCE:/home/jovyan/shared  ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm129:current\n\nGo to the With the container running instructions...\nWith the container running:\nIn a browser, go to localhost:8129\nUse the token: letmein\nOn notebook homepage, click to select the content folder, then in notebook homepage toolbar select Move, and enter /shared in the moved to path.\n\nYou should then be able to view the notebooks in shared/content in the notebook UI and the notebooks should also be on host in TM129VCE/content\nNote that the nbev3devsim simulator used throughout the notebooks requires you to access the materials via a recent Chrome browser.\nHTML version\nAn HTML version (maybe?!) of the materials in the repo is available here: https://innovationoutside.github.io/tm129-robotics2020/. Note that this site may lag the materials in the repo by few days...\nThis repository defines the computing environment for the practical activities for the 20J update to the OU TM129 robotics block.\nA Docker container image built from the repository using repo2docker is available on Dockerhub: ousefuldemos/tm129-robotics2020\nRelease:\ndocker pull ousefuldemos/tm129-robotics2020:latest && docker image tag ousefuldemos/tm129-robotics2020:latest ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm129:current && docker push ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm129:current\nGetting Started\nYou can explore the contents of this repository via interactive Jupyter notebooks by clicking the Binder button above.\nTo run the environment on your own computer, you need to do the following:\n\n\ninstall Docker onto your computer; you can download the installation files from the Docker website: Get Docker\n\n\nopen a terminal / command prompt in your desktop; from the command prompt, do the following:\n\n\ncreate a working directory / folder to work in by entering the command: mkdir TM129;\n\n\nchange directory into that fold by running the command: cd TM129;\n\n\nrun the command docker pull ousefuldemos/tm129-robotics2020:latest to pull down the Docker container image from Docker Hub; (if you have previously downloaded the image, this will downloaded any updated version of it);\n\n\non a Mac at least, launch the docker container by running the command: docker run --name tm129vce -p 8129:8888 -v ""$PWD:/home/jovyan/notebooks""  -e JUPYTER_TOKEN=""letmein"" ousefuldemos/tm129-robotics2020:latest\n\n(the quotes round the volume mount cope with spaces in the $PWD directory path)\n\n\n\nstop (hibernate) the container with the command: docker stop tm129vce\n\n\nrestart the container with the command: docker restart tm129vce\n\n\n\n\nOn Windows, use a run command of the form:\ndocker run --name tm129vce -d -p 8129:8888 -v $pwd\\notebooks:/home/jovyan/notebooks -e JUPYTER_TOKEN=""letmein"" ousefuldemos/tm129-robotics2020:latest\nWhen you run the docker command, several things will happen:\n\nfirst, docker will download the container image from DockerHub (this may take some time but only happens the first time you try to run the container);\nthen, docker will launch the container and a Jupyter notebook server will start running inside it.\n\nWhen the container is running, go to localhost:8129 in your browser (if that doesn\'t work, try 127.0.0.1:8129) and you should see a running notebook server there.\nUse the token letmein to access the server (you should only need to do this once).\nAny files in the local TM129 directory on your host computer should appear in the notebooks folder in the notebook homepage directory listing.\nTeaching Materials\nThe repository also contains drafts of the practical activity teaching materials. These materials are ""unpublished"" and ©The Open University, 2020; they are posted here purely to support commentary and review during development. The initial draft of the materials is essentially a recasting of the original materials and activities into a form that uses a new user environment (Jupyter notebooks) and new simulation environment (nbev3devsim, based on ev3devsim).\nWhen starting the Docker container, if you mount the current working directory on host onto the /home/jovyan directory in the container, it will clobber all the files that were are the top level of this repo that are otherwise baked into the container.\nHowever, some essential file from the top level of the repo directory are also stashed in the $CONDA_DIR/workfiles/recover directory.\nLaunch a notebook terminal and run the command:\ncp -ir $CONDA_DIR/workfiles/recover/* /home/jovyan/\nto recover the files into clobbered home directory. This files will then be place in your current working directory. (Omit the i flag if you do not want to be warned about overwriting any files.)\nOpen Computing Lab\nThis repo is being developed according to (emerging!) Open Computing Lab principles.

The tests can be a useful starting point.\nFeedback\nThere are some reasons to use robot feedback. The two most frequently faced:\n\nMultiple controllers compete for controlling the robot via a multiplexer. A controller that has been excluded by another with higher priority may suddenly issue commands significantly different to the\nlast commanded velocity when the multiplexer has switched back to it. i.e. the commanded velocity\nprofile experiences a large, discrete jump. In these cases, option 2 is very useful.\nThe robot fails to generate the commanded velocity due to, for example, unmodelled inclines, carpets etc. In these cases, option 1 is very useful.\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/kobuki-base', 'info_list': ['5', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Feb 2, 2021', '9', 'MATLAB', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Jan 15, 2020', '7', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', '42', 'TypeScript', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Mar 2, 2021', 'HTML', 'Updated Feb 24, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 25, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 13, 2020', '4', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 28, 2020', '5', 'C++', 'Updated Mar 26, 2020', '4', 'Python', 'Updated Jul 21, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '4 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Team5810XbotsRobotics2020\nOfficial Repository for the Team 5810 Xbots Robotics Team.

Computer science is an integral part of robotics as it includes areas such as computer algorithms, artificial intelligence, and image processing that are essential aspects of robotics. This course will teach the students fundamentals of robotics along with various software, hardware for robot developments based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) which is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms. This course will provide hands-on experience with lab activities and practical knowledge from semester-long projects. During the semester, the students will build a Battle Bot based on a customized TurtleBot with ROS. And the class will host a battle bot competition at the end of the semester as a part of the class.

If a student misses a class, the student is responsible for bringing herself/himself up-to-date on class material and assignments. If you miss more than 4 classes without a documented reason or without making prior arrangements with me, your final grade will be dropped one grade (A to B, B+ to C+ and so on).\nAll students are expected to read the assigned chapters prior to coming to class.\n\n\nExams\n\nExams will be based on the combination of: material covered in lectures, the assigned reading from the reference papers/textbooks and material covered in the notes.\nAll exams are closed books and closed notes.\n\n\nHomework assignments\n\nAll homework assignments must be returned through the Blackboard LEARN. If the instructor requests to return an assignment directly in class, the assignment is due at the beginning of class on the specified date. Assignments turned in after the beginning of class on the due date will be counted as one day late and will receive 3 points of penalty.\nLate penalty will be applied to all the assignment returned late. An assignment turned in n days late will get 3*n points deduction. An assignment cannot be more than 7 days late. After the 7th day the assignment will not be accepted.\nAll assignments must be individually and independently completed. Should two or more students turn in substantially the same solution or program, in the judgment of the instructor, the solution will be considered a group effort. All involved in group effort homework will receive a zero grade for that assignment. (See more details on cheating and plagiarism in the Academic Honesty Policy section below).\nYou may discuss the interpretation of an assignment with your classmates; however you may not discuss possible solutions unless you are requested by your teacher to share your solution with your colleagues.\nNo late assignment will be accepted after the assignment is graded and solution discussed.\n\n\nMake-up exams\n\nMake-up exams will only be given in case of serious need and only when the instructor is notified prior to the exam time. If this is not done, the grade is automatically 0 for that exam.\nWritten verification for the student’s inability to take an exam will be required.\n\n\nClass cancellation & Campus closings\n\nAnnouncements of class cancellations and/or campus closings will be made on the campus homepage. In the case of an emergency, weather-related or otherwise, please check the web page at www.kent.edu for information on the buildings and times of the closing. While information may be broadcast by radio and television, this should be confirmed by the web page, which is the official announcement of the campus and which will be the information used to determine issues related to student attendance, rescheduling of tests, and other concerns.\nIf I need to cancel class for any reason, I will try to put an announcement on the course web page as early as possible.\n\n\nCourse Withdrawal\n\nIf you are considering withdrawing from this course, please consult with a staff member in the Student Services Office, 134 Main Hall. Withdrawal from a course can affect financial aid, student status, or progress within your major. For withdrawal deadlines, please refer to: http://www.kent.edu/registrar/spring-important-dates.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\nUse of the intellectual property of others without attributing it to them is considered a serious academic offense. Cheating or plagiarism will result in a failing grade for the work or for the entire course. Repeat offenses result in dismissal from the University. University guidelines require that all infractions be reported to the Student Conduct Officer on our campus. Kent State University policy on academic honesty can be found at: http://www.kent.edu/plagiarism\n\n\nStudents with Disabilities\n\nUniversity policy 3-01.3 requires that students with disabilities be provided reasonable accommodations to ensure their equal access to course content. If you have a documented disability and require accommodations, please contact the instructor at the beginning of the semester to make arrangements for necessary classroom adjustments. Please note, you must first verify your eligibility for these through Student Accessibility Services (contact 330-672-3391 or visit http://www.kent.edu/sas for more information on registration procedures).\n\n\nConduct\n\nStudents and faculty behavior at the Kent State University is governed by the guidelines summarized in the Code of Conduct page that you can find at\nhttp://www.kent.edu/studentconduct/code-studentconduct.\n\n\nEmergency\n\nIn case of an emergency please contact the security on campus.\n\nPick up the receiver of any blue-light phone on campus\nSecurity cell phone (330) 672-2212 or, of course, 911.\n\n\n\n\n\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/ksu-cs-robotics', 'info_list': ['1', 'C++', 'Updated Apr 19, 2020', '1', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 18, 2021', '7', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 7, 2021', '3', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 12, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', 'Updated Jan 15, 2020', 'Updated Jan 18, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 21, 2020', 'Updated Jan 19, 2020', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020']}","{'location': 'Berlin', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '1,485 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': [""React Robot Server\nnpm start\nIf running locally, the devlopment app is available at localhost:3000. \nIf running on the server, nginx should redirect dev.hotstname.com to hostname.com:3000 where the app is listening.

Nothing is expected to fully work.\nI\'m still far away from a final version. If you should experience any issues or bugs, please open an issue in this repository.\nCharlieOSX\nBy XilefTech from the ""Lego Spirits""\n\nSummary\nCharlieOSX is a Project, meant to be used in all kinds of driving Lego Mindstorms EV3 Robots, with support for other types of robots maybe coming in the future.\nCharlieOSX offers a wide feature set with the two main things being:\n\nHighly accurate and self-correcting driving methods based on gyro-sensor data\nAn on-Brick GUI for Programing, testing and using of programs without the need of a computer at all.\n\nIt will be FLL-Ready (as soon as the basic feature set is fully implemented and tested).\nAlso it will help you to improve your movements through showing important data in the screen while driving. (Not implemented yet)\nHow to use CharlieOSX with your robot:\n\n\nInstall Ev3dev or Pybricks on your brick.\n\n\nDownload and open this project in VS code\n\n\nOpen the config.py file and fill in everything that is needed about your robot\n\n\nYou can now add as many execute() functions as you like to the end of the main.py file with an array with the number codes.

When your robot is connected to your local WIFI network, make sure the robots local IP-adress and the localIP in the config match.\nTo then start the webremote call the run() function:\nCharlieOSX = CharlieOSX(\'config.cfg\', \'settings.json\', \'\')\nCharlieOSX.webremote.run()\nNow the webserver will start and you can acess the webremote with any webbrowser at < yourBrickIP >:8081 so for example 192.168.178.52:8081\n\nThe interface is pretty simple:\n\nA joystick for moving the robot\nA slider to control the velocity of an action motor\nA slider to set the maximum speed for the robot\n\nMore Information\nYou will always be able to find more (detailed) information about the project in the wiki.\nIf there are still questions left, after visiting our wiki, feel free to ask in an issue!\nContributors\n\nXilefTech\nGerhardBenkovsky\nTheGreydiamond\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/XilefTech', 'info_list': ['1', 'C++', 'Updated Apr 19, 2020', '1', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 18, 2021', '7', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 7, 2021', '3', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 12, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', 'Updated Jan 15, 2020', 'Updated Jan 18, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 21, 2020', 'Updated Jan 19, 2020', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': [""FRC Team 5549's 2019-2020 Robot Code\nThis is the code for FRC Team 5549's robot 2020 Season: Infinite Recharge\nDeploying Code\n\nMove to the folder with the code using cd [directory name]\nConnect to the robot's WiFi\nDeploy code to the robot using py -3 robot.py deploy.

Their development often relies on building application-specific simulation environments, and using the information to train reinforcement learning (RL) models.\nThe following figure (a screenshot from Gazebo) shows you a simulation environment on AWS RoboMaker. This sample robot operating system (ROS) app sets up the environment where an agent is placed in a simple maze. Some of you might be curious about what meiro means? Meiro stands for a maze in Japanese.\n\nAn RL algorithm will help navigate the agent to reach to the GOAL without bumping into a wall. The agent has a 360-degree surround lidar scanner (360 points x 5 fps) so that it monitors the distance from the surrounding walls all around. The lidar data are used to describe a state at a given step within an episode. The agent makes a decision out of 5 different actions i.e. turn left, turn right, move straight, steer to the left, and steer to the right. (To learn more about the reinforcement learning framework used for this application, Coach, please take a look at the following link)\nPreparation\nThis sample application is expected to be executed from AWS RoboMaker.\nOn AWS RoboMaker development environment, execute following commands to prepare the environment (Kinetic and Melodic are supported).\ncd ~/environment\ngit clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-robomaker-sample-application-meirorunner.git  MeiroRunner\ncd MeiroRunner\n./ws_setup.sh\n\nThe setup script will create AWS resources to run the application and the created resources are noted in ws_settings.yaml file.\nThe setup script will then build the application, the whole process will take around 20 minitue to complete.\nHow to use on AWS RoboMaker\nTo train machine larning model with reinforcement learning using robomaker simulator,  select Run -> Launch Simulation -> MeiroRunner Training from the menu of RoboMaker development environment.\nTo evaluate the machine learning model, select Run -> Launch Simulation -> MeiroRunner Evaluate.\nTo modify and rebuild the application, modify the code on AWS RoboMaker development environment and slect Run -> Workflow -> Meiro Runner build -> bundle all. This will update the buid files for the application.\nTo run the macnine learning model in the real-life using a physical robot (i.e. Turtlebot3 Burger), you can use a launch file bringup_robot.launch in meiro_runner_robot package.\nThe robot application is under robot_ws direcotry, to build and deploy the application to physical robots, please refer to RoboMaker documentation.\nFollowing is the configuration for robot application running in Turtlebot3 Burger.\n\nPackage name: meiro_runner_robot\nLaunch file: bringup_robot.launch\nEnvironment variables:\n\nMARKOV_PRESET_FILE: meiro_runner.py\nMODEL_FILE: model/model.pb\nMODEL_S3_PREFIX: model-store\nROS_AWS_REGION: <copy the value of aws_region from ws_setting.yaml>\nMODEL_S3_BUCKET: <copy the value of bucket_name from ws_setting.yaml>\n\n\n\nLicense\nThis library is licensed under the MIT-0 License.

Then, I applied Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) Reinforcement Learning to learn a gait. Finally, I built the real robot and tested my learned policy. I used OpenAI Gym so you can just plug and play your code!\n\nAs the sim-to-real experiment was unsuccessful, I implemented a simple sinewave-based trajectory for the robot's feet and solved the Inverse Kinematics using this paper. Based on this implementation, I learned that the robot needs wider hips, a lower CoM, and higher-torque motors for any RL policy to be deployed. Here's a video of the manual trajectory:\n\nThe core project components were:\n\nPytorch to construct the six deep neural networks required by TD3 Reinforcement Learning.\nPyBullet for simulating the robot and environment.\nRViz and Gazebo for an alternate ROS-based simulation, as well as for constructing and testing the URDF mechanically and dynamically.\nThe Real Robot was 3D printed and can be controlled using either joint position replay, or by sampling actions from a policy.\n\nTo read the theory behind each element of this project, please visit my portfolio website\nQuickstart guide\n\nfork this repository, then download and build using wstool and catkin_make if you want to use the Gazebo Environment.\nTo run the Gazebo training script, source your workspace, and write roslaunch plen_ros plen_walk.launch td3:=True\nTo run the Pybullet training script, simple navigate to plen_td3.py under the src directory in the plen_bullet package, and run.\nTo evaluate a policy in Pybullet, navigate to the above directory, and run walk_eval.py. You will need to open the file and edit the policy number to choose a different one.\nTo evaluate the manual trajectory in Pybullet, navigate to the above directory and run trajectory_eval.py. Feel free to go one directory deeper into trajectory_generator.py and edit the gait parameters to your liking.\nTo run  a policy or to replay a trajectory on the real robot, you will need to send the plen_real package to the robot's Raspberry Pi. Then, navigate into that package's src directory, and run plen_real.py and follow the instructions on screen. To deploy a policy, you will need to run main_plen_walk_pc.py on your computer to send the robot's pose as measured by an overhead camera. Note that you will need to calibrate the camera and IMU following the instructions linked.\nFinally, if you would like to use your own RL script on this robot, you can do so by importing plen_env.py either from the plen_bullet or plen_ros packages and use them as you would any other OpenAI Gym Environment.\n\nDependencies\n\nROS Melodic\nGazebo\nPytorch\nPybullet\nGym\nOpenCV\nAdadfruit Servo Toolkit\nAdafruit Sensor Toolkit\n\nPackages\nplen_bullet\nThis package holds the Pybullet implementation of the project. The src directory contains  the training script, plen_td3.py, the policy evaluation script walk_eval.py, and the manual trajectory evaluation script trajectory_eval.py. Move one directory below, and you will see plen_env.py, which contains the OpenAI Gym and Bullet interface, as well as trajectory_generator.py, a script used to generate sinewave trajectories for the robot's feet, along with corresponding joint angles found using an analytical Inverse Kinematics solver.\nplen_real\nThis package holds the live implementation of this project. This package should be sent to the robot's Raspberry Pi Zero W, and the plen_real.py script should be run there. The main_walk_pc.py script should be run on the host computer, as it records the robot position using OpenCV in the object_detector.py script, and sends it to the Pi using sockets. The robot's motors are controlled using the servo_model.py script which contains the ServoJoint object with actuation and measurement capabilities. The IMU is controlled using the imu.py script containing the IMU object with measurement and calibration capabilities. Finally, the UDP Client and Server objects are located in the socket_comms.py script.\nplen_ros\nThis was the first package in the project, and for this reason contains the TD3 RL implementation which the other packages borrow from. It also contains the Gazebo equivalent of plen_bullet, but it is not recommended for use unless you have a Quadrupedal robot to simulate, as Gazebo's inability to deterministically step a simulation makes it difficult to train bipedal robots due to the variable amount of time required for training the Agent, which makes realtime training tricky.\nThis package also contains the urdf files for the robot in xacro format. This needs to be converted to urdf for use in Pybullet, which is why the plen_bullet package contains its own urdf, identical to the one here.\nCAD files\nThe files presented in the cad directory were modified to fit 9g servo motors, as well as a Raspberry Pi and PWM board instead of the stock components recommended by the PLEN Project Company.\n\nRequired Components & Assembly\n\nRaspberry Pi Zero W\nPWM Board\nFS90-FB Servo Motors or TowerPro 9g\nIMU\n60FPS Camera for pose tracking (sim runs at 60Hz)\n4.8V Battery\nADC\nForce Sensing Resistor for Foot Contact\n\nFor assembly instructions, please follow this guide by the PLEN Project Company. Feel free to use the servo_calibration_basic.py script to help you align the servo horns. Note that a software offset of 9 degrees was applied to each servo motor (see plen_real.py in plen_real) to zero them properly.\nFuture Work\nOne method of closing the sim-to-real gap is to increase the fidelity of the simulation. This has been done for quadrupedal robots in Pybullet, so it should be possible for PLEN as well. In addition, I noticed that Gazebo more accurately represents contacts, so an alternate or parallel route for improvement would be to implement a plugin to deterministically step the simulation while still applying joint commands.\nFinally, while this was not my original goal, I inadvertedly dove into Zero Moment Point trajectory generation for bipedal robots during the final week of this project. Although the topic requires significantly more research for me to implement (hence why I opted for open-loop sinewave-based foot trajectories), it is definitely worthwhile. It would be interested to apply a ZMP-based gait, and use RL to improve upon it.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/moribots', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'Updated Jan 19, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 15, 2020', '5', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 21, 2020', '2', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'Updated Jan 13, 2020', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', 'C#', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Aug 24, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 6, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Mar 2, 2020']}","{'location': 'localhost', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '641 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/vanessayuenn', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'Updated Jan 19, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 15, 2020', '5', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 21, 2020', '2', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'Updated Jan 13, 2020', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', 'C#', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Aug 24, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 6, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Mar 2, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '0 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['modularRobotics_ROS\nToolbox for the development and operation of modular robots in ROS.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/MatthiasAlthoff', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'Updated Jan 19, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 15, 2020', '5', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 21, 2020', '2', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'Updated Jan 13, 2020', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', 'C#', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Aug 24, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 6, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Mar 2, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '205 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['ROS Robotics By Example\nThis is the code repository for ROS Robotics By Example, published by Packt.

This should provide more responsive, yet stable, speed control.\nPIDF adds Feedforward control to the basic PID control loop.\nFeedforward is useful when controlling a motor\'s speed because it ""anticipates"" how much the control voltage\nmust change to achieve a new speed set-point, rather than requiring the integrated error to change sufficiently.\nThe PIDF values were chosen to provide responsive, yet stable, speed control on a lightly loaded motor.\nThe more heavily a motor is loaded (drag or friction), the more noticable the PIDF improvement will be.\nFixes startup crash on Android 10\nFixes ftc_app issue #712 (thanks to FROGbots-4634)\nFixes ftc_app issue #542\nAllows ""A"" and lowercase letters when naming device through RC and DS apps.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.2 (20190905-083227)\n\nFixes extra-wide margins on settings activities, and placement of the new configuration button\nAdds Skystone Vuforia image target data.\n\nIncludes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Java).\nIncludes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Blocks).\n\n\nAdds TensorFlow inference model (.tflite) for Skystone game elements.\n\nIncludes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Java).\nIncludes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Blocks).\n\n\nRemoves older (season-specific) sample op modes.\nIncludes 64-bit support (to comply with Google Play requirements).\nProtects against Stuck OpModes when a Restart Robot is requested. (Thanks to FROGbots-4634) (ftc_app issue #709)\nBlocks related changes:\n\nFixes bug with blocks generated code when hardware device name is a java or javascript reserved word.\nShows generated java code for blocks, even when hardware items are missing from the active configuration.\nDisplays warning icon when outdated Vuforia and TensorFlow blocks are used (SkyStone issue #27)\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.1 (20190820-222104)\n\nDefines default PIDF parameters for the following motors:\n\nREV Core Hex Motor\nREV 20:1 HD Hex Motor\nREV 40:1 HD Hex Motor\n\n\nAdds back button when running on a device without a system back button (such as a Control Hub)\nAllows a REV Control Hub to update the firmware on a REV Expansion Hub via USB\nFixes SkyStone issue #9\nFixes ftc_app issue #715\nPrevents extra DS User clicks by filtering based on current state.\nPrevents incorrect DS UI state changes when receiving new OpMode list from RC\nAdds support for REV Color Sensor V3\nAdds a manual-refresh DS Camera Stream for remotely viewing RC camera frames.\n\nTo show the stream on the DS, initialize but do not run a stream-enabled opmode, select the Camera Stream option in the DS menu, and tap the image to refresh. This feature is automatically enabled when using Vuforia or TFOD—no additional RC configuration is required for typical use cases. To hide the stream, select the same menu item again.\nNote that gamepads are disabled and the selected opmode cannot be started while the stream is open as a safety precaution.\nTo use custom streams, consult the API docs for CameraStreamServer#setSource and CameraStreamSource.\n\n\nAdds many Star Wars sounds to RobotController resources.\nAdded SKYSTONE Sounds Chooser Sample Program.\nSwitches out startup, connect chimes, and error/warning sounds for Star Wars sounds\nUpdates OnBot Java to use a WebSocket for communication with the robot\n\nThe OnBot Java page no longer has to do a full refresh when a user switches from editing one file to another\n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nCamera Stream\n\nThe Vuforia camera stream inherits the issues present in the phone preview (namely ftc_app issue #574). This problem does not affect the TFOD camera stream even though it receives frames from Vuforia.\nThe orientation of the stream frames may not always match the phone preview. For now, these frames may be rotated manually via a custom CameraStreamSource if desired.\n\n\nOnBotJava\n\nBrowser back button may not always work correctly\nIt\'s possible for a build to be queued, but not started. The OnBot Java build console will display a warning if this occurs.\nA user might not realize they are editing a different file if the user inadvertently switches from one file to another since this switch is now seamless. The name of the currently open file is displayed in the browser tab.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.0 (built on 19.06.14)\n\nSupport for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\nAdds a Java preview pane to the Blocks editor.\nAdds a new offline export feature to the Blocks editor.\nDisplay wifi channel in Network circle on Driver Station.\nAdds calibration for Logitech C270\nUpdates build tooling and target SDK.\nCompliance with Google\'s permissions infrastructure (Required after build tooling update).\nKeep Alives to mitigate the Motorola wifi scanning problem.  Telemetry substitute no longer necessary.\nImproves Vuforia error reporting.\nFixes ftctechnh/ftc_app issues 621, 713.\nMiscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.3 (built on 18.10.31)\n\nIncludes missing TensorFlow-related libraries and files.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.2 (built on 18.10.30)\n\nIncludes fix to avoid deadlock situation with WatchdogMonitor which could result in USB communication errors.\n\nComm error appeared to require that user disconnect USB cable and restart the Robot Controller app to recover.\nrobotControllerLog.txt would have error messages that included the words ""E RobotCore: lynx xmit lock: #### abandoning lock:""\n\n\nIncludes fix to correctly list the parent module address for a REV Robotics Expansion Hub in a configuration (.xml) file.\n\nBug in versions 4.0 and 4.1 would incorrect list the address module for a parent REV Robotics device as ""1"".\nIf the parent module had a higher address value than the daisy-chained module, then this bug would prevent the Robot Controller from communicating with the downstream Expansion Hub.\n\n\nAdded requirement for ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION to allow a Driver Station running Android Oreo to scan for Wi-Fi Direct devices.\nAdded google() repo to build.gradle because aapt2 must be downloaded from the google() repository beginning with version 3.2 of the Android Gradle Plugin.\n\nImportant Note: Android Studio users will need to be connected to the Internet the first time build the ftc_app project.\nInternet connectivity is required for the first build so the appropriate files can be downloaded from the Google repository.\nUsers should not need to be connected to the Internet for subsequent builds.\nThis should also fix buid issue where Android Studio would complain that it ""Could not find com.android.tools.lint:lint-gradle:26.1.4"" (or similar).\n\n\nAdded support for REV Spark Mini motor controller as part of the configuration menu for a servo/PWM port on the REV Expansion Hub.\nProvide examples for playing audio files in an Op Mode.\nBlock Development Tool Changes\n\nIncludes a fix for a problem with the Velocity blocks that were reported in the FTC Technology forum (Blocks Programming subforum).\nChange the ""Save completed successfully."" message to a white color so it will contrast with a green background.\nFixed the ""Download image"" feature so it will work if there are text blocks in the op mode.\n\n\nIntroduce support for Google\'s TensorFlow Lite technology for object detetion for 2018-2019 game.\n\nTensorFlow lite can recognize Gold Mineral and Silver Mineral from 2018-2019 game.\nExample Java and Block op modes are included to show how to determine the relative position of the gold block (left, center, right).\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.1 (released on 18.09.24)\nChanges include:\n\nFix to prevent crash when deprecated configuration annotations are used.\nChange to allow FTC Robot Controller APK to be auto-updated using FIRST Global Control Hub update scripts.\nRemoved samples for non supported / non legal hardware.\nImprovements to Telemetry.addData block with ""text"" socket.\nUpdated Blocks sample op mode list to include Rover Ruckus Vuforia example.\nUpdate SDK library version number.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.0 (released on 18.09.12)\nChanges include:\n\n\nInitial support for UVC compatible cameras\n\nIf UVC camera has a unique serial number, RC will detect and enumerate by serial number.\nIf UVC camera lacks a unique serial number, RC will only support one camera of that type connected.\nCalibration settings for a few cameras are included (see TeamCode/src/main/res/xml/teamwebcamcalibrations.xml for details).\nUser can upload calibration files from Program and Manage web interface.\nUVC cameras seem to draw a fair amount of electrical current from the USB bus.\n\nThis does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n\n\n\n\nThis does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.\nFTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.\n\n\nUpdated sample Vuforia Navigation and VuMark Op Modes to demonstrate how to use an internal phone-based camera and an external UVC webcam.\n\n\n\nSupport for improved motor control.\n\nREV Robotics Expansion Hub firmware 1.8 and greater will support a feed forward mechanism for closed loop motor control.\nFTC SDK has been modified to support PIDF coefficients (proportional, integral, derivative, and feed forward).\nFTC Blocks development tool modified to include PIDF programming blocks.\nDeprecated older PID-related methods and variables.\nREV\'s 1.8.x PIDF-related changes provide a more linear and accurate way to control a motor.\n\n\n\nWireless\n\nAdded 5GHz support for wireless channel changing for those devices that support it.\n\nTested with Moto G5 and E4 phones.\n\n\n\n\nAlso tested with other (currently non-approved) phones such as Samsung Galaxy S8.\n\n\n\nImproved Expansion Hub firmware update support in Robot Controller app\n\nChanges to make the system more robust during the firmware update process (when performed through Robot Controller app).\nUser no longer has to disconnect a downstream daisy-chained Expansion Hub when updating an Expansion Hub\'s firmware.\n\nIf user is updating an Expansion Hub\'s firmware through a USB connection, he/she does not have to disconnect RS485 connection to other Expansion Hubs.\n\n\n\n\nThe user still must use a USB connection to update an Expansion Hub\'s firmware.\nThe user cannot update the Expansion Hub firmware for a downstream device that is daisy chained through an RS485 connection.\n\n\nIf an Expansion Hub accidentally gets ""bricked"" the Robot Controller app is now more likely to recognize the Hub when it scans the USB bus.\n\nRobot Controller app should be able to detect an Expansion Hub, even if it accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.\n\n\n\n\nRobot Controller app should be able to install the firmware onto the Hub, even if if accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.\n\n\n\nResiliency\n\nFTC software can detect and enable an FTDI reset feature that is available with REV Robotics v1.8 Expansion Hub firmware and greater.\n\nWhen enabled, the Expansion Hub can detect if it hasn\'t communicated with the Robot Controller over the FTDI (USB) connection.\n\n\n\n\nIf the Hub hasn\'t heard from the Robot Controller in a while, it will reset the FTDI connection.\nThis action helps system recover from some ESD-induced disruptions.\n\n\nVarious fixes to improve reliability of FTC software.\n\n\n\nBlocks\n\nFixed errors with string and list indices in blocks export to java.\nSupport for USB connected UVC webcams.\nRefactored optimized Blocks Vuforia code to support Rover Ruckus image targets.\nAdded programming blocks to support PIDF (proportional, integral, derivative and feed forward) motor control.\nAdded formatting options (under Telemetry and Miscellaneous categories) so user can set how many decimal places to display a numerical value.\nSupport to play audio files (which are uploaded through Blocks web interface) on Driver Station in addition to the Robot Controller.\nFixed bug with Download Image of Blocks feature.\nSupport for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\nSupport for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor.\nAdded support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device).\nAdded blocks for DcMotorEx methods.\n\nThese are enhanced methods that you can use when supported by the motor controller hardware.\n\n\n\n\nThe REV Robotics Expansion Hub supports these enhanced methods.\nEnhanced methods include methods to get/set motor velocity (in encoder pulses per second), get/set PIDF coefficients, etc..\n\n\n\nModest Improvements in Logging\n\nDecrease frequency of battery checker voltage statements.\nRemoved non-FTC related log statements (wherever possible).\nIntroduced a ""Match Logging"" feature.\n\nUnder ""Settings"" a user can enable/disable this feature (it\'s disabled by default).\n\n\n\n\nIf enabled, user provides a ""Match Number"" through the Driver Station user interface (top of the screen).\n\nThe Match Number is used to create a log file specifically with log statements from that particular Op Mode run.\nMatch log files are stored in /sdcard/FIRST/matlogs on the Robot Controller.\nOnce an op mode run is complete, the Match Number is cleared.\nThis is a convenient way to create a separate match log with statements only related to a specific op mode run.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Devices\n\nSupport for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\nSupport for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor.\nAdded configuration option for REV 20:1 HD Hex Motor.\nAdded support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device).\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFixed some errors in the definitions for acceleration and velocity in our javadoc documentation.\nAdded ability to play audio files on Driver Station\nWhen user is configuring an Expansion Hub, the LED on the Expansion Hub will change blink pattern (purple-cyan)  to indicate which Hub is currently being configured.\nRenamed I2cSensorType to I2cDeviceType.\nAdded an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates localization using 2018-2019 (Rover Ruckus presented by QualComm) Vuforia targets.\nAdded an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics 2m Laser Distance Sensor.\nAdded an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\nRe-categorized external Java sample Op Modes to ""TeleOp"" instead of ""Autonomous"".\n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\n\nInitial support for UVC compatible cameras\n\nUVC cameras seem to draw significant amount of current from the USB bus.\n\nThis does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n\n\n\n\nThis does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.\nFTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.\n\n\nThere might be a possible deadlock which causes the RC to become unresponsive when using a UVC webcam with a Nougat Android Robot Controller.\n\n\n\nWireless\n\nWhen user selects a wireless channel, this channel does not necessarily persist if the phone is power cycled.\n\nTech Team is hoping to eventually address this issue in a future release.\n\n\n\n\nIssue has been present since apps were introduced (i.e., it is not new with the v4.0 release).\n\n\nWireless channel is not currently displayed for WiFi Direct connections.\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe blink indication feature that shows which Expansion Hub is currently being configured does not work for a newly created configuration file.\n\nUser has to first save a newly created configuration file and then close and re-edit the file in order for blink indicator to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 3.6 (built on 17.12.18)\nChanges include:\n\nBlocks Changes\n\nUses updated Google Blockly software to allow users to edit their op modes on Apple iOS devices (including iPad and iPhone).\nImprovement in Blocks tool to handle corrupt op mode files.\nAutonomous op modes should no longer get switched back to tele-op after re-opening them to be edited.\nThe system can now detect type mismatches during runtime and alert the user with a message on the Driver Station.\n\n\nUpdated javadoc documentation for setPower() method to reflect correct range of values (-1 to +1).\nModified VuforiaLocalizerImpl to allow for user rendering of frames\n\nAdded a user-overrideable onRenderFrame() method which gets called by the class\'s renderFrame() method.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 3.5 (built on 17.10.30)\nChanges with version 3.5 include:\n\nIntroduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which can occur after the Robot Controller app has been paused and then resumed (for example, when a user temporarily turns off the display of the Robot Controller phone, and then turns the screen back on).\nIntroduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which were previously caused by random peer disconnect events on the Driver Station.\nFixes issue where log files would be closed on pause of the RC or DS, but not re-opened upon resume.\nFixes issue with battery handler (voltage) start/stop race.\nFixes issue where Android Studio generated op modes would disappear from available list in certain situations.\nFixes problem where OnBot Java would not build on REV Robotics Control Hub.\nFixes problem where OnBot Java would not build if the date and time on the Robot Controller device was ""rewound"" (set to an earlier date/time).\nImproved error message on OnBot Java that occurs when renaming a file fails.\nRemoved unneeded resources from android.jar binaries used by OnBot Java to reduce final size of Robot Controller app.\nAdded MR_ANALOG_TOUCH_SENSOR block to Blocks Programming Tool.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 3.4 (built on 17.09.06)\nChanges with version 3.4 include:\n\nAdded telemetry.update() statement for BlankLinearOpMode template.\nRenamed sample Block op modes to be more consistent with Java samples.\nAdded some additional sample Block op modes.\nReworded OnBot Java readme slightly.\n\n\nVersion 3.3 (built on 17.09.04)\nThis version of the software includes improves for the FTC Blocks Programming Tool and the OnBot Java Programming Tool.\nChanges with verion 3.3 include:\n\nAndroid Studio ftc_app project has been updated to use Gradle Plugin 2.3.3.\nAndroid Studio ftc_app project is already using gradle 3.5 distribution.\nRobot Controller log has been renamed to /sdcard/RobotControllerLog.txt (note that this change was actually introduced w/ v3.2).\nImprovements in I2C reliability.\nOptimized I2C read for REV Expansion Hub, with v1.7 firmware or greater.\nUpdated all external/samples (available through OnBot and in Android project folder).\nVuforia\n\nAdded support for VuMarks that will be used for the 2017-2018 season game.\n\n\nBlocks\n\nUpdate to latest Google Blockly release.\nSample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode.\nFixed bug where the blocks would disappear temporarily when mouse button is held down.\nAdded blocks for Range.clip and Range.scale.\nUser can now disable/enable Block op modes.\nFix to prevent occasional Blocks deadlock.\n\n\nOnBot Java\n\nSignificant improvements with autocomplete function for OnBot Java editor.\nSample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode.\nFixes and changes to complete hardware setup feature.\nUpdated (and more useful) onBot welcome message.\n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nAndroid Studio\n\nAfter updating to the new v3.3 Android Studio project folder, if you get error messages indicating ""InvalidVirtualFileAccessException"" then you might need to do a File->Invalidate Caches / Restart to clear the error.\n\n\nOnBot Java\n\nSometimes when you push the build button to build all op modes, the RC returns an error message that the build failed.  If you press the build button a second time, the build typically suceeds.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 3.2 (built on 17.08.02)\nThis version of the software introduces the ""OnBot Java"" Development Tool.  Similar to the FTC Blocks Development Tool, the FTC OnBot Java Development Tool allows a user to create, edit and build op modes dynamically using only a Javascript-enabled web browser.\nThe OnBot Java Development Tool is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is served up by the Robot Controller.  Op modes are created and edited using a Javascript-enabled browser (Google Chromse is recommended).  Op modes are saved on the Robot Controller Android device directly.\nThe OnBot Java Development Tool provides a Java programming environment that does NOT need Android Studio.\nChanges with version 3.2 include:\n\n\nEnhanced web-based development tools\n\nIntroduction of OnBot Java Development Tool.\nWeb-based programming and management features are ""always on"" (user no longer needs to put Robot Controller into programming mode).\nWeb-based management interface (where user can change Robot Controller name and also easily download Robot Controller log file).\nOnBot Java, Blocks and Management features available from web based interface.\n\n\n\nBlocks Programming Development Tool:\n\nChanged ""LynxI2cColorRangeSensor"" block to ""REV Color/range sensor"" block.\nFixed tooltip for ColorSensor.isLightOn block.\nAdded blocks for ColorSensor.getNormalizedColors and LynxI2cColorRangeSensor.getNormalizedColors.\n\n\n\nAdded example op modes for digital touch sensor and REV Robotics Color Distance sensor.\n\n\nUser selectable color themes.\n\n\nIncludes many minor enhancements and fixes (too numerous to list).\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nAuto complete function is incomplete and does not support the following (for now):\n\nAccess via this keyword\nAccess via super keyword\nMembers of the super cloass, not overridden by the class\nAny methods provided in the current class\nInner classes\nCan\'t handle casted objects\nAny objects coming from an parenthetically enclosed expression\n\n\n\n\nVersion 3.10 (built on 17.05.09)\nThis version of the software provides support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub.  This version also includes improvements in the USB communication layer in an effort to enhance system resiliency.  If you were using a 2.x version of the software previously, updating to version 3.1 requires that you also update your Driver Station software in addition to updating the Robot Controller software.\nAlso note that in version 3.10 software, the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods are no longer available (not deprecated, they have been removed from the SDK). Also note that the the new 3.x software incorporates motor profiles that a user can select as he/she configures the robot.\nChanges include:\n\nBlocks changes\n\nAdded VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener.getPose and Vuforia.trackPose blocks.\nAdded optimized blocks support for Vuforia extended tracking.\nAdded atan2 block to the math category.\nAdded useCompetitionFieldTargetLocations parameter to Vuforia.initialize block.  If set to false, the target locations are placed at (0,0,0) with target orientation as specified in https://github.com/gearsincorg/FTCVuforiaDemo/blob/master/Robot_Navigation.java tutorial op mode.\n\n\nIncorporates additional improvements to USB comm layer to improve system resiliency (to recover from a greater number of communication disruptions).\n\n\nAdditional Notes Regarding Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)\nIn addition to the release changes listed below (see section labeled ""Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.013)""), version 3.00 has the following important changes:\n\nVersion 3.00 software uses a new version of the FTC Robocol (robot protocol).  If you upgrade to v3.0 on the Robot Controller and/or Android Studio side, you must also upgrade the Driver Station software to match the new Robocol.\nVersion 3.00 software removes the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods from the DcMotor class.  If you have an op mode that formerly used these methods, you will need to remove the references/calls to these methods.  Instead, v3.0 provides the max speed information through the use of motor profiles that are selected by the user during robot configuration.\nVersion 3.00 software currently does not have a mechanism to disable extra i2c sensors.  We hope to re-introduce this function with a release in the near future.\n\n\nVersion 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)\n*** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***\nThis software is being released as an ""alpha"" version.  Use this version at your own risk!\nThis pre-release software contains SIGNIFICANT changes, including changes to the Wi-Fi Direct pairing mechanism, rewrites of the I2C sensor classes, changes to the USB/FTDI layer, and the introduction of support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub and the REV Robotics color-range-light sensor.  These changes were implemented to improve the reliability and resiliency of the FTC control system.\nPlease note, however, that version 3.00 is considered ""alpha"" code.  This code is being released so that the FIRST community will have an opportunity to test the new REV Expansion Hub electronics module when it becomes available in May.  The developers do not recommend using this code for critical applications (i.e., competition use).\n*** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***\nChanges include:\n\nMajor rework of sensor-related infrastructure.

This is important - we no longer set the motor modes through the motor controller.\nsetMode and getMode were added to the DcMotor class.\nContinuousRotationServo class has been added to the FTC SDK.\nRange.clip() method has been overloaded so it can support this operation for int, short and byte integers.\nSome changes have been made (new methods added) on how a user can access items from the hardware map.\nUsers can now set the zero power behavior for a DC motor so that the motor will brake or float when power is zero.\nPrototype Blockly Programming Mode has been added to FTC Robot Controller.  Users can place the Robot Controller into this mode, and then use a device (such as a laptop) that has a Javascript enabled browser to write Blockly-based Op Modes directly onto the Robot Controller.\nUsers can now configure the robot remotely through the FTC Driver Station app.\nAndroid Studio project supports Android Studio 2.1.x and compile SDK Version 23 (Marshmallow).\nVuforia Computer Vision SDK integrated into FTC SDK.  Users can use sample vision targets to get localization information on a standard FTC field.\nProject structure has been reorganized so that there is now a TeamCode package that users can use to place their local/custom Op Modes into this package.\nInspection function has been integrated into the FTC Robot Controller and Driver Station Apps (Thanks Team HazMat… 9277 & 10650!).\nAudio cues have been incorporated into FTC SDK.\nSwap mechanism added to FTC Robot Controller configuration activity.  For example, if you have two motor controllers on a robot, and you misidentified them in your configuration file, you can use the Swap button to swap the devices within the configuration file (so you do not have to manually re-enter in the configuration info for the two devices).\nFix mechanism added to all user to replace an electronic module easily.  For example, suppose a servo controller dies on your robot. You replace the broken module with a new module, which has a different serial number from the original servo controller.  You can use the Fix button to automatically reconfigure your configuration file to use the serial number of the new module.\nImprovements made to fix resiliency and responsiveness of the system.\nFor LinearOpMode the user now must for a telemetry.update() to update the telemetry data on the driver station.  This update() mechanism ensures that the driver station gets the updated data properly and at the same time.\nThe Auto Configure function of the Robot Controller is now template based.  If there is a commonly used robot configuration, a template can be created so that the Auto Configure mechanism can be used to quickly configure a robot of this type.\nThe logic to detect a runaway op mode (both in the LinearOpMode and OpMode types) and to abort the run, then auto recover has been improved/implemented.\nFix has been incorporated so that Logitech F310 gamepad mappings will be correct for Marshmallow users.\n\n\nRelease 16.07.08\n\nFor the ftc_app project, the gradle files have been modified to support Android Studio 2.1.x.\n\n\nRelease 16.03.30\n\nFor the MIT App Inventor, the design blocks have new icons that better represent the function of each design component.\nSome changes were made to the shutdown logic to ensure the robust shutdown of some of our USB services.\nA change was made to LinearOpMode so as to allow a given instance to be executed more than once, which is required for the App Inventor.\nJavadoc improved/updated.\n\n\nRelease 16.03.09\n\nChanges made to make the FTC SDK synchronous (significant change!)\n\nwaitOneFullHardwareCycle() and waitForNextHardwareCycle() are no longer needed and have been deprecated.\nrunOpMode() (for a LinearOpMode) is now decoupled from the system\'s hardware read/write thread.\nloop() (for an OpMode) is now decoupled from the system\'s hardware read/write thread.\nMethods are synchronous.\nFor example, if you call setMode(DcMotorController.RunMode.RESET_ENCODERS) for a motor, the encoder is guaranteed to be reset when the method call is complete.\nFor legacy module (NXT compatible), user no longer has to toggle between read and write modes when reading from or writing to a legacy device.\n\n\nChanges made to enhance reliability/robustness during ESD event.\nChanges made to make code thread safe.\nDebug keystore added so that user-generated robot controller APKs will all use the same signed key (to avoid conflicts if a team has multiple developer laptops for example).\nFirmware version information for Modern Robotics modules are now logged.\nChanges made to improve USB comm reliability and robustness.\nAdded support for voltage indicator for legacy (NXT-compatible) motor controllers.\nChanges made to provide auto stop capabilities for op modes.\n\nA LinearOpMode class will stop when the statements in runOpMode() are complete.  User does not have to push the stop button on the driver station.\nIf an op mode is stopped by the driver station, but there is a run away/uninterruptible thread persisting, the app will log an error message then force itself to crash to stop the runaway thread.\n\n\nDriver Station UI modified to display lowest measured voltage below current voltage (12V battery).\nDriver Station UI modified to have color background for current voltage (green=good, yellow=caution, red=danger, extremely low voltage).\njavadoc improved (edits and additional classes).\nAdded app build time to About activity for driver station and robot controller apps.\nDisplay local IP addresses on Driver Station About activity.\nAdded I2cDeviceSynchImpl.\nAdded I2cDeviceSync interface.\nAdded seconds() and milliseconds() to ElapsedTime for clarity.\nAdded getCallbackCount() to I2cDevice.\nAdded missing clearI2cPortActionFlag.\nAdded code to create log messages while waiting for LinearOpMode shutdown.\nFix so Wifi Direct Config activity will no longer launch multiple times.\nAdded the ability to specify an alternate i2c address in software for the Modern Robotics gyro.\n\n\nRelease 16.02.09\n\nImproved battery checker feature so that voltage values get refreshed regularly (every 250 msec) on Driver Station (DS) user interface.\nImproved software so that Robot Controller (RC) is much more resilient and “self-healing” to USB disconnects:\n\nIf user attempts to start/restart RC with one or more module missing, it will display a warning but still start up.\nWhen running an op mode, if one or more modules gets disconnected, the RC & DS will display warnings,and robot will keep on working in spite of the missing module(s).\nIf a disconnected module gets physically reconnected the RC will auto detect the module and the user will regain control of the recently connected module.\nWarning messages are more helpful (identifies the type of module that’s missing plus its USB serial number).\n\n\nCode changes to fix the null gamepad reference when users try to reference the gamepads in the init() portion of their op mode.\nNXT light sensor output is now properly scaled.  Note that teams might have to readjust their light threshold values in their op modes.\nOn DS user interface, gamepad icon for a driver will disappear if the matching gamepad is disconnected or if that gamepad gets designated as a different driver.\nRobot Protocol (ROBOCOL) version number info is displayed in About screen on RC and DS apps.\nIncorporated a display filter on pairing screen to filter out devices that don’t use the “-“ format. This filter can be turned off to show all WiFi Direct devices.\nUpdated text in License file.\nFixed formatting error in OpticalDistanceSensor.toString().\nFixed issue on with a blank (“”) device name that would disrupt WiFi Direct Pairing.\nMade a change so that the WiFi info and battery info can be displayed more quickly on the DS upon connecting to RC.\nImproved javadoc generation.\nModified code to make it easier to support language localization in the future.\n\n\nRelease 16.01.04\n\nUpdated compileSdkVersion for apps\nPrevent Wifi from entering power saving mode\nremoved unused import from driver station\nCorrrected ""Dead zone"" joystick code.\nLED.getDeviceName and .getConnectionInfo() return null\napps check for ROBOCOL_VERSION mismatch\nFix for Telemetry also has off-by-one errors in its data string sizing / short size limitations error\nUser telemetry output is sorted.\nadded formatting variants to DbgLog and RobotLog APIs\ncode modified to allow for a long list of op mode names.\nchanges to improve thread safety of RobocolDatagramSocket\nFix for ""missing hardware leaves robot controller disconnected from driver station"" error\nfix for ""fast tapping of Init/Start causes problems"" (toast is now only instantiated on UI thread).\nadded some log statements for thread life cycle.\nmoved gamepad reset logic inside of initActiveOpMode() for robustness\nchanges made to mitigate risk of race conditions on public methods.\nchanges to try and flag when WiFi Direct name contains non-printable characters.\nfix to correct race condition between .run() and .close() in ReadWriteRunnableStandard.\nupdated FTDI driver\nmade ReadWriteRunnableStanard interface public.\nfixed off-by-one errors in Command constructor\nmoved specific hardware implmentations into their own package.\nmoved specific gamepad implemnatations to the hardware library.\nchanged LICENSE file to new BSD version.\nfixed race condition when shutting down Modern Robotics USB devices.\nmethods in the ColorSensor classes have been synchronized.\ncorrected isBusy() status to reflect end of motion.\ncorrected ""back"" button keycode.\nthe notSupported() method of the GyroSensor class was changed to protected (it should not be public).\n\n\nRelease 15.11.04.001\n\nAdded Support for Modern Robotics Gyro.\n\n\nThe GyroSensor class now supports the MR Gyro Sensor.\nUsers can access heading data (about Z axis)\nUsers can also access raw gyro data (X, Y, & Z axes).\nExample MRGyroTest.java op mode included.\n\n\nImproved error messages\n\n\nMore descriptive error messages for exceptions in user code.\n\n\nUpdated DcMotor API\nEnable read mode on new address in setI2cAddress\nFix so that driver station app resets the gamepads when switching op modes.\nUSB-related code changes to make USB comm more responsive and to display more explicit error messages.\n\n\nFix so that USB will recover properly if the USB bus returns garbage data.\nFix USB initializtion race condition.\nBetter error reporting during FTDI open.\nMore explicit messages during USB failures.\nFixed bug so that USB device is closed if event loop teardown method was not called.\n\n\nFixed timer UI issue\nFixed duplicate name UI bug (Legacy Module configuration).\nFixed race condition in EventLoopManager.\nFix to keep references stable when updating gamepad.\nFor legacy Matrix motor/servo controllers removed necessity of appending ""Motor"" and ""Servo"" to controller names.\nUpdated HT color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbLegacyModule class.\nUpdated MR color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbDeviceInterfaceModule class.\nCorrectly handle I2C Address change in all color sensors\nUpdated/cleaned up op modes.\n\n\nUpdated comments in LinearI2cAddressChange.java example op mode.\nReplaced the calls to ""setChannelMode"" with ""setMode"" (to match the new of the DcMotor  method).\nRemoved K9AutoTime.java op mode.\nAdded MRGyroTest.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Gyro Sensor).\nAdded MRRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Color Sensor).\nAdded HTRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use HT legacy color sensor).\nAdded MatrixControllerDemo.java (demonstrates how to use legacy Matrix controller).\n\n\nUpdated javadoc documentation.\nUpdated release .apk files for Robot Controller and Driver Station apps.\n\nT.

It does so using Gazebo, ROS1, and Docker. This allows to\nquickly start and stop a simulator without having to struggle too much setting\nup dependencies. It also allows to run multiple simulators in parallel (with or\nwithout GUI) to explore learning based approaches to robot control.\nFeatures\n\nEasy setup to control the robot in python (rospy)\nProcess isolation to allow multiple simulators on a single node (no GUI)\nFreely configurable (and scriptable) world\nEasy migration and sharing\nRuns on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux\n\nKnow of any features that could be added? Found a bug? Please open an issue in this repo.\nAdditionally, if you like this repo, consider giving it a star. Positive feedback lets\nme know that there is interest in this topic, and I will do more work like this.\nInstallation\nYou should have Docker, Docker-compose, and git installed on your system before\ninstalling this Simulator. Each project is heavily in use and there are tons of\ngood tutorials online.\nFirst install and build the images:\ngit clone https://github.com/FirefoxMetzger/panda_gazebo_sim.git \ndocker-compose build\n\nROS is a fairly large image, and we are compiling some code during the build.\nThe first build may take a bit longer while caches are being populated.\nIf you wish to use the Gazebo GUI to show the world and the robot moving around\nin it, you will have to share your display with the docker container running\nGazebo.\nOn Linux\nThe ROS Docker documentation has a section on how to set this\nup. You will have to\ndecide for the level of security; if you are just briefly playing around with\nit, the first option may suffice. If you are planning something more\nsophisticated, you may wish to use the options listed further down.\nOn Windows\nOn Windows it depends a bit on how you run Docker for Windows. On a resonably\nmodern system you will have access to WSL, and I highly recommend you use this\nas a backend to run docker containers.\nTo forward the GUI from docker\'s linux host to Windows, you will have to (for\nnow) perform X11 forwarding using a 3d party program. Several good options exist\nand in the near future this step will become obsolete as WSL annonoced that it\nwill add GUI support. You can get an overview of your options\nhere,\nthough I think that the best option currently is to use vcXsrv.\nWeb Client\nA feature that I am working on currently is to add\nGzWeb to the stack. This will make using a\nGUI much simpler, because it will run directly in your browser of choice.\nWorkflows\nScripting\ndocker-compose run rospy\n\nThis will start the simulator in the background and drop you into a shell within\nthe ROS ecosystem. The scripts folder of this repo will be mounted into the\nshell\'s container and you can run the python scripts inside to control the\nrobot. Take a look at the examples and feel free to add scripts based on your\nneeds.\nRViZ (requires GUI)\ndocker-compose run rviz\n\nThis will start the simulator in the background and launch RViZ. You can\nthen control the simulated robot by planning movements in RViZ.\nClean-Up\ndocker-compose down\n\nThis will clean up any residuals and temorary files created by the simulator,\nsuch as dangling containers, volumes, virtual networks, etc.\nConfiguration\nThere are several useful configuration options for the simulator. These are set\nby either (a) temorarily overwriting the default values set in the\ndocker-compose file (see below), or (b) permanently adjusting the\ndocker-compose.\nTurning off the GUI\nTODO: Write documentation\nMultiple Simulators (process-level parallelization)\nTODO: Write documentation\nChanging Worlds/Environments\nTODO: Write documentation\nYour own Gazebo world\nTODO: Update Documentation\nTo rock your own gazebo world mount your custom worlds and models directories\nin the locations where they are stored in the image:\ndocker run \\\n    --volume=""<absolute/path/to/your/panda.world>:/catkin_ws/src/panda_gazebo/worlds/"" \\\n    --volume=""<absolute/path/to/your/models/folder/>:/catkin_ws/src/panda_gazebo/models"" \\\n    panda_gazebo_sim\n\nKeep in mind that the world file has to be called panda.world.\nOther repos you may find useful\nOfficial Franka Emika ROS Package\nA more sophisticated Panda Simulator\nAnother Panda Simulator\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/FirefoxMetzger', 'info_list': ['1', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 2, 2020', '2', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', '5', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 6, 2020', 'Updated Jan 17, 2020', 'CMake', 'Updated Jan 17, 2020', '5', 'CMake', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Feb 23, 2021', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 15, 2020', 'Updated Jan 13, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '1 contribution\n        in the last year', 'description': ['PennX-Robotics-Dynamics-and-Control\nProjects\n\nTrajectory Tracking with a Mobile Robot\nQuadrotor Trajectory Tracking Controller\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/phc260', 'info_list': ['1', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 2, 2020', '2', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', '5', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 6, 2020', 'Updated Jan 17, 2020', 'CMake', 'Updated Jan 17, 2020', '5', 'CMake', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Feb 23, 2021', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 15, 2020', 'Updated Jan 13, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': [""Brazilian-Institute-of-Robotis.github.io\nBIR's page\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Brazilian-Institute-of-Robotics', 'info_list': ['1', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 2, 2020', '2', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', '5', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 6, 2020', 'Updated Jan 17, 2020', 'CMake', 'Updated Jan 17, 2020', '5', 'CMake', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Feb 23, 2021', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 15, 2020', 'Updated Jan 13, 2020']}","{'location': 'Berlin / Tokyo', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '482 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': [""open in markdown viewer for more better view.\nBID light sensor classifier algorithm challenge\nJotaro, 2020/01/10\nTask\nYour task is to complete int predict(int [], int) that predicts whether incoming data is black, gray or white.\nIn this function you can use:\n\narray of obtained data so far, and its length\n\nYou must not edit any other lines in code except for above function.\nSensor data\nEach data values belongs to one of three classes:{ 0-black, 1-gray, 2-white}.\nThe data point follows three different Gaussian distribution with different mean and deviation unknown to each other.\nFormat\nYou don't have to code the data reading procedure but the prepared code should do (tested with macOS Catalina clang environment).\nN\nd1 l1\nd2 l2\n...\ndN lN\n\nEvaluation\nYour code will be tested both with existing test data (data1.txt -

Thus, this is a lap oriented class providing hands-on-experiences through a selected fun project such as rescueRobot,miniDrone, autonomous miniCar, etc. Further, students may have an\nopportunity to participate in various currently ongoing projects which are conducted at several laboratories (ATR Lab, Scale Lab, etc.) in the CS department. Especially, students will gain knowledge and ideas from those projects for their future capstone project in terms of project management as well as advanced technologies in intelligent robot systems, Internet-of-Things, etc. \nThe course project will involve significant programming and hardware works. For Spring 2020, mini Rescue Robot project will be conducted. Each student will build a simple ground robot and its control programming from scratch. At the end of the semester, all students will have their final project presentation and mini RobotCup-Rescue competition as parts of class outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n [RoboCup Rescue Challenge] \n\n\n\n [An Example Ongoing Project at ATR Lab] \n\nLearning Outcomes:\nStudents completing this course will\n\nlearn the theoretical & practical base for robot and control system design by building a simple\ndrone and control interface\nbecome familiar with robotics and embedded system\ndeepen the knowledge of the robots and their components\nunderstand how to conduct an individual and group project\nHand-on-Experience with robot system (drone), embedded system (Arduino), sensors, Python.\n\nRequired Text:\nNo Textbook is required, but various handouts/example-codes/selected hardware for building a ground robot will be provided.\n[Recommended texts for your references]\n\n“Introduction to Multicopter Design and Control”, 1st ed. 2017 Edition. by Quan Quan (Author) - Publisher: Springer - (ISBN-10: 9789811033810)\n“Physical Computing: Sensing and Controlling the Physical World with Computers” 1st Edition”, Dan O'Sullivan and Tom Igoe, (ISBN-10: 159200346X), (ISBN-13: 978-1592003464)\n“Arduino Cookbook- 2nd Edition”, Michael Margolis, (ISBN-10: 1449313876) , (ISBN-13:978-1449313876)\n\nGrading:\nStudents will be evaluated based on the following course activities and graded based on the following weighting:\n\n\n\nItem\nPercentage\n(Individual/Group)\n\n\n\n\nAttendance, Participation, and (in class) Pop Quiz\n10%\nindividual\n\n\nAssignments\n20%\nindividual\n\n\nMidterm Exam\n10%\nindividual\n\n\nRobot competition\n20%\nindividual\n\n\nFinal Report & Presentations\n20%\nindividual\n\n\nFinal Exam\n20%\nindividual\n\n\nTotal\n100%\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nTotal Percentage Earned\nGrade\nTotal Percentage Earned\n\n\n\n\nA\n92.5 – 100% or above\nC+\n77.5 – 79.9%\n\n\nA-\n89.5 – 92.4%\nC\n72 – 77.4%\n\n\nB+\n87 – 89.4%\nC-\n68.5 – 71.9 %\n\n\nB\n82.5 – 86.9%\nD\n68.5 – 71.9 %\n\n\nB-\n80 – 82.4%\nF\n62% and below\n\n\n\n\nAssignments: Simple programming and hardware building assignments for this course will be given.

You willperform individual project work, consistent throughout the semester. You will build a robot (a simple quadcopter by DIY). In addition, each student may have an opportunity to participate currently ongoing projects which are conducted at several laboratories and learn documentation and management of projects as well as the design and prototyping process.\n\nTentative Outline of the Course:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek1\n01/13/2020\nIntroduction of Robotics and Embedded System Lab course, schedule/requirements\n\n\n\n01/15/2020\nOpen Discussion for the class project\n\n\nWeek2\n01/20/2020\nMartin Luther King Jr Day\n\n\n\n01/22/2020\nSetup Development Environment (Arduino, RPi, Linux Command and GitHub)\n\n\nWeek3\n01/27/2020\nBasic Component - Electronic Component [Diode, Resistor, etc] , Microcontroller [Arduino]\n\n\n\n01/29/2020\n- Wiring on a breadboard,\n\n\nWeek4\n02/03/2020\nMotion Control - DC Motor and Analog Servo\n\n\n\n02/05/2020\n- Arduino (Digital and Analog Output)\n\n\nWeek5\n02/10/2020\nDigital Sensing - Button and Switch\n\n\n\n02/12/2020\n- Arduino (Digital Input )\n\n\nWeek6\n02/17/2020\nRemote Control - Bluetooth Serial\n\n\n\n02/19/2020\n- Communication (UART, Protocol, and Message Parsing)\n\n\nWeek7\n02/24/2020\nProject A - RC Control Car\n\n\n\n02/26/2020\n- Competition A\n\n\nWeek8\n03/02/2020\nAnalog Sensing - Joystick\n\n\n\n03/04/2020\n- Arduino (Analog Input) and Competition B\n\n\nWeek9\n03/09/2020\nSensor 1 - Proximity sensor (Sonar, IR Sensor)\n\n\n\n03/11/2020\n- Arduino (Digital and Analog Input) and Competition C\n\n\nWeek10\n03/16/2020\nSensor 2 - Encoder\n\n\n\n03/18/2020\n- Arduino (Digital and Analog Input) and Competition D\n\n\nWeek11\n03/23~03/25\nSpring Break\n\n\nWeek12\n03/30/2020\nSensor 2 - IMU Sensor\n\n\n\n04/01/2020\n- Arduino (I2C Communication) and Competition E\n\n\nWeek13\n04/06/2020\nSensoring Enhancement\n\n\n\n04/08/2020\n- Noise Filtering\n\n\nWeek14\n04/13/2020\nControlling Enhancement\n\n\n\n04/15/2020\n- PID control\n\n\nWeek15\n04/20/2020\nRobot Competition - Final\n\n\n\n04/22/2020\nIntroduction to Advanced Technologies\n\n\nWeek16\n04/27/2020\nFinal Project Presentation - (10min presentation & 5 min QnA)\n\n\n\n04/29/2020\nFinal Exam\n\n\n\nCourse policy:\n\nClass participation and preparation\n\nClass participation and regular attendance are expected. If a student misses a class, the student is responsible for bringing herself/himself up-to-date on class material and assignments. If you miss more than 4 classes without a documented reason or without making prior arrangements with me, your final grade will be dropped one grade (A to B, B+ to C+ and so on).\nAll students are expected to read the assigned chapters prior to coming to class.\n\n\nExams\n\nExams will be based on the combination of: material covered in lectures, the assigned reading from the reference papers/textbooks and material covered in the notes.\nAll exams are closed books and closed notes.\n\n\nHomework assignments\n\nAll homework assignments must be returned through the Blackboard LEARN. If the instructor requests to return an assignment directly in class, the assignment is due at the beginning of class on the specified date. Assignments turned in after the beginning of class on the due date will be counted as one day late and will receive 3 points of penalty.\nLate penalty will be applied to all the assignment returned late. An assignment turned in n days late will get 3*n points deduction. An assignment cannot be more than 7 days late. After the 7th day the assignment will not be accepted.\nAll assignments must be individually and independently completed. Should two or more students turn in substantially the same solution or program, in the judgment of the instructor, the solution will be considered a group effort. All involved in group effort homework will receive a zero grade for that assignment. (See more details on cheating and plagiarism in the Academic Honesty Policy section below).\nYou may discuss the interpretation of an assignment with your classmates; however you may not discuss possible solutions unless you are requested by your teacher to share your solution with your colleagues.\nNo late assignment will be accepted after the assignment is graded and solution discussed.\n\n\nMake-up exams\n\nMake-up exams will only be given in case of serious need and only when the instructor is notified prior to the exam time. If this is not done, the grade is automatically 0 for that exam.\nWritten verification for the student’s inability to take an exam will be required.\n\n\nClass cancellation & Campus closings\n\nAnnouncements of class cancellations and/or campus closings will be made on the campus homepage. In the case of an emergency, weather-related or otherwise, please check the web page at www.kent.edu for information on the buildings and times of the closing. While information may be broadcast by radio and television, this should be confirmed by the web page, which is the official announcement of the campus and which will be the information used to determine issues related to student attendance, rescheduling of tests, and other concerns.\nIf I need to cancel class for any reason, I will try to put an announcement on the course web page as early as possible.\n\n\nCourse Withdrawal\n\nIf you are considering withdrawing from this course, please consult with a staff member in the Student Services Office, 134 Main Hall. Withdrawal from a course can affect financial aid, student status, or progress within your major. For withdrawal deadlines, please refer to: http://www.kent.edu/registrar/spring-important-dates.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\nUse of the intellectual property of others without attributing it to them is considered a serious academic offense. Cheating or plagiarism will result in a failing grade for the work or for the entire course. Repeat offenses result in dismissal from the University. University guidelines require that all infractions be reported to the Student Conduct Officer on our campus.

The Arduino side handles all the servo movements and gets measurement readings from the Lidar sensor. The Java side does the spherical to cartesian points conversion and renders them in 3D. They communicate with each other over the serial port. The user can move around the scene with game-like fps controls for a better experience.\nThe Math\nThere are two servos in the project. One will be used as the Pan (Phi) angle and the other as the Tilt (Theta) angle. The reading we get from the Lidar sensor will become the Radius. Which means that device itself would be at point (0,0,0). Each data set sent from the Arduino to the Java program consists of these three numbers (radius, phi, theta) with leading zeroes for consistency.\nFrom here we have to convert these Spherical points to Cartesian(x, y, z) so we can properly plot them in our Java program.\nWe can achieve these conversions using these formulas.\nNote: If you look inside the Java code and notice that some of the values of x, y, and z are swapped, some times even set to negative, that\'s because the computer coordinate system is different as well. For example, in computer coordinates, the x goes horizontal not y. Y positive goes down, not up. Things like that. These modifications made to the formula were only to get Java to render the points in the correct place.\nSerial Communication\nI started this project with an Arduino Uno but ran into problems with the serial port conflicting with the servos. They cannot work at the same time. When data was being sent back and forth, the servos would jitter constantly. From research I learned that this was a common problem using SoftwareSerial. I found some workarounds for this problem but they were such a hassle and didn\'t work for me. I decided to switch to an Arduino Mega and it solved the jittering problem. This is because the Mega has multiple serial ports.\nThe steps of communicating\n-Java opens port and listens for data\n-Arduino takes first measurement, moves the servos to the next position and wait for an ""Okay"" signal from Java\nArduino sends the data to Java in this format 000,000,000\n-Java waits for all the fragments of data to reach a certain amount that is enough to convert\n-Java converts those numbers, plots the point, and send the Arduino a single char as the ""Okay"" signal\n-Once the Arduino receives the signal, it repeats what it did before at the new angle positions\nThe reason Java has to wait is because even though you tell the Arduino to send 9 digits and 2 commas, sending data over serial does not work that way. It will send fragments of whatever data it wants whenever it can. So we want Java to until all the data received looks like something it can recognize.\nI used a USB cable as the serial connection but I am sure one could use a bluetooth module as well if wireless was needed.\nPowering The Project\nI used a 5v wall brick to run the servos because I just hate dealing with batteries and avoid them when possible. The Lidar sensor was powered through the Arduino 5V. And of course the Arduino was powered with the same USB cable that was used as a serial port.\nPrerequisites\n\nJava - Java Runtime Environment\nArduino - Arduino Mega Microcontroller\nTFMini(UART) - TFMini Lidar sensor\njSerialComm-2.5.1 - Arduino Serial Communication Library for Java\nMG996R Servo x 2 - 180 degrees standard servos\n\nProgrammed In\n\nNetbeans - Java IDE\nArduino - Arduino IDE\n\nSchematic\n\nScreenshots\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\n\nTravis Ledo - Initial work - LidarScanRender\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/TravisLedo', 'info_list': ['2', 'Java', 'Updated Dec 2, 2020', '7', 'Java', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 31, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 15, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 15, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '0 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': [""Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Introducing GitHub\nWelcome to your repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course.

Trying to rewrite the firmware and use as a robotic platform and add a robotic arm.\nIn my apartment complex, someone through away this robotic vaccum. It looks like solid base to use as a robotics platform. I have identified all the components and their headers. I will continually add to this readme, as I work throguh the problems associated with reverse engineering this board.\n1/19/20\nI\'m about done with this ultasonic sensor system. It is operational, the only hiccups I\'m having are with refresh rates to the display ( which isn\'t really relevant to the final implementation I plan on using here). I\'ve identified the chip and found what I believe to be a debug/uart port on the PCB labeled J11. I\'m going to go through the datasheet and learn a little bit before I start messing with it, as all of my experience with ARM processors (in a non ..""end user capacity"") have been in a linux environement on the raspberry pi. I have more experience with 8-bit AVR processors (328p,ATMEGA1280,ATMEGA2560) and Espressif processors (ESP8266 and ESP32), as those chips are easier to translate from dev board into my own hardware with a soldering iron nad components.\n\nI definently want to utilize the motor drivers and IR sensors. This will save a lot of work testing new components and the wiring harnesses are already built. That being said I need to get into the STM32f030 and rewrite the firmware. Below is a picture of the PCB, and I believe I have found a UART port I may be able to utilize.\n\nAnd on the back I have soldered some jumper wires so I can easily connect/disconnect to this header.\n\nI\'ve built a control box and small 1DoF ultrasonic detection system I wish to place on the end of a stepper driven 2DoF arm. I would like to use the original PCB because I don\'t really want to spend the time reintegrating these sensors and motors with mystery encoder boards.\n\nLooking through the datasheet we find the pinout, and voltage/current characteristics for this processor:\nExamining the chip markings we find: STM32F030 R8T6\nR - 64 pins\n8 - 64 kbyte of flash\nT - LQFP package\n6 -  (-40,85) degree C operating range\nand we must make sure to stay within the characterized ranges for voltage\n\n... and current, during testing and operation. If one does not adhere, most likely you will experience the fabled magic smoke. If this happens, you are observing the soul of your chip ascending into silicon heaven.\n\nLooking on the board, it\'s mostly populated by passive components, I can see an LM224 and LM258.....which are quad/dual op amp ICs. That\'s not very useful for our purposes. Each of the main wheel motors have a small pcb with what appears to be small encoder pcb. We don\'t really need to mess with any of this right now, but it\'s good to know what all the components on your board are doing.\nI\'m not totally alone. I have found a repository by Elias Kotlyar who has a good breakdown of a very similar model...and with what appears to be the exact pcb from my V3s.\nCheck out his repo here:\nhttps://github.com/EliasKotlyar/IlifeX5Disassembly\nHe has created a good labeled image of the pcb. I\'ve indicated on the front of the pcb the 4 pins I have soldered wires to. This is our initial point of attack.\nThe below picture was made by Kotlyar , not myself\n\nYou know what... I\'m going to stop right and just email the manufacturer. The company is based out of ShenZen, and the culture there is a little more open to the notion of sharing. I\'m going to ask for schematics to the main PCB as there are a lot of vias aroudn the JP11 header and it\'s hard to visually trace them. I\'ll still use a multimeter to test continuity to these mcu pins, but it really couldn\'t hurt to ask.\n2/1/2020:\n7am:\nI\'ve found some good references over the past few weeks, as I\'ve been pretty busy. I\'m reading all I can / doing some coding problems until Jiu Jitsu at noon,\nThen I\'m gonna take a crack at this thing.\n-YouTube video from a European seminar on reverse engineering an SDR ( will post link later ) I\nhttps://youtu.be/GX8-K4TssjY\n-Guide on reverse engineering firmware from stm32f1xx ( this board is f3xx though)\nhttps://medium.com/techmaker/reverse-engineering-stm32-firmware-578d53e79b3\nFrom what I understand, I need to do a null pointer dereference/make a read\nFrom 0x00 in attempt to dump the first firmware from memory.\nAfter I get this, I need to search for string literals which may be used as a\nKey if it is encrypted. I must however first find ports to connect JTAG or UART...  I have an STLINK v2 , and this is the only stm32 I have acess to currently...after an interview for a job I have gathered that I must in fact gain experience working with this processor type.\n5:15pm\nThe first thing I need to do, is to find what pins connect to this J11 port and hopefully... it\'s uart.\nWith a multimeter I checked, rechecked, and triple checked the pins and maked the pins from which continuity existed between the port J11 pins and the processor\'s pins. Initially, looking at the back of the PCB traces... I guessed the top first hole on the port was power and that the second was ground...as the second was not isolated from the ground plane. I have just completed this continuity test, and I believe that assumption may be correct.\n\nI still have to ascertain which is pin#1 as there are circles in two corners of the processor on this board. I have drawn color coded lines corresponding to the color of wires I have soldered to the j11 port (as seen above). NOTE that that board is necessarily oriented in the same position as in above pictures. This is in attempt to show the chip markings.\n\n8:15pm After careful testing and combing through the data sheet, I have ascertained that port J11 is not a uart port...it\'s a a single wire (SWDIO/SWCLK) interface.\nThis is an STMF030 R8T6 and I believe pin 49  (my labeled D) may have TX function on usart2.\nA: Pins 1,13,32,64 - VDD - power (max 4v, 13 is analog)\nB: Pins 12,31,63 - VSS - ground (12 is analog)\nC: Pin 46 - PA13 - SWDIO\nD: Pin 49 - PA14 - SWCLK  (/USART2_TX - untested)\n\nI have an ST-Link V2, I\'m going to see what I can do. I predict the manufacturer has the firmware protected and I won\'t be able to read... but we\'ll see.\n2/6/2020\n8:30pm:\nOver the last few days, I\'ve been looking through data sheet and mapping out the other pins...as I was hoping for a UART interface. This is the method utilized in hacking the Roomba... I found a link to a pdf (over 400 pages) to this if you\'re interested:\nhttps://www.robotiklubi.ee/_media/kursused/roomba_sumo/failid/hacking_roomba.pdf\nIf anyone is interested (these are not yet tested) however I pulled these pin numbers and double checked, from the data sheet for the chip. I have several interface pins labeled:\n\nI decided to take off the wires I had soldered on the board and add a male pins. The spacing on j11 is smaller than normal breadboard headers, so I had to break them off individually and cut down the plastic spacers/turn them sideways to fit. below is an image of this process, it\'s pretty self explanatory. Don\'t solder wires onto the port, it\'s a pain to get the extra solder out of the holes ... I wish I had added these pins initially.\n\nI\'ve hooked it up to the st-link and the board makes some noise, it has a little buzzer on it. This leads me to believe the chip is good and memory still contains the firmware in working form. After it boots up, the st-link has an error and disconnects. This board has several voltage regulators and a couple motor drivers. I have all the harnesses disconnected from the board, so my instinct tells me that they shouldn\'t be drawing power...but I\'m wondering if those are drawing current and I may need to power the board from an external power supply to keep the main chip operating stable?\nI\'m going to try to utilize the single wire debug port as is with an st-link. This is my first delve into the stm32, but since I need to learn it anyways ...I bought 2 stm32 dev boards (blue pill) and am learning to work with the Arm Embedded Toolchain in ubuntu with them. I want some practice before I take a crack at this board, because I don\'t want to brick it/loose my chance at pulling off the firmware. I believe it will take a lot more time if I have to test each of these sensors on the front harness and write new code to utilize them (bump sensors, a pleatheora of ir sensors, and  3 pairs of emitter/detector pairs).\n2/7/2020\n7:30am\nI had opened some links last night to read in the morning... and I happened upon two other people who are working on different iLife robotic vacuum models. I\'ll be honest, it\'s encouraging to see other people working at these things. I gotta give credit:\nhttps://ci8.it/haier-t32x.html\nHe has seemed to find some success via UART.\nand\nhttp://roboforum.ru/forum90/topic16676.html / https://github.com/linvinus/open_ilife\nThe project page is in Russian but can be translated in google. They have some good details here as well.\n2/8/2020\nI\'ve got the st-link to connect to the board but I beleive there is read out protection in place. Everything peritnent is betwen 0x0...0 and 0x2000 0000.\n\nAbove is a map of the memory on the chip. I made several attempts to read from different starting and ending addresses (listed them by starting adress and size respectively on the filenames) ...and I\'m getting nothing but null... with some bits early on.\nThe files are in my ""memoryreadattempts"" folder. I will follow this name convention followed my attempt # once I make more progress.\nI heard about this paper in a talk and am currently working through it:\nShedding too much Light on a Microcontroller\'s Firmware Protection\nwritten by Johannes Obermaier and Stefan Tatschner\nhttps://www.aisec.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/aisec/ResearchExcellence/woot17-paper-obermaier.pdf\nI\'ve seen a few exploits on youtube. One steps through the processor cycles one step at a time and re-writes the register where the readout protection is on and nother exploits a race condition to read out memory one word at a time. I\'m going to call it a night, but I\'m getting better at using these tools. I will find success.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/kbickham', 'info_list': ['2', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 21, 2021', '2', 'Updated Feb 9, 2020', '3', 'C', 'Updated Aug 30, 2020', '3', 'Java', 'BSD-2-Clause license', 'Updated Mar 27, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 13, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 13, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 13, 2020', 'HTML', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 13, 2020']}","{'location': 'Evanston, IL', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '423 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Swarm Robotic Platform\nJosh Cohen\nIntro\nWith the goal of making decentralized, equitable, and sustainable systems, swarm robotic systems seem like a promising framework.

"{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': [""Nonlinear Constrained Optimization with Ipopt\n\nPrerequisites\nTo tackle this assignment you would need to know the following:\n\nHow to deal with simple Linear Algebra.\nA tiny bit of Physics. In particular, the concepts of Force and Torque.\nHow to apply Newton's First Law for linear and rotational motion.\nA bare understanding of static friction.\nThe basics of Ipopt.\n\nAssignment\nYou are set in a 2D world where an object is given with an irregular shape (Figure 1). The object is characterized by a static friction coefficient\nand there exists already a force F0 applied to a certain location of the object's perimeter, pointing inward. As it is known, The friction cone establishes\nan area − thinner for smaller coefficients and wider for larger coefficients − where F0 does not bring about any slippage between the object and the effector\nof an external agent exerting the force.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎯 The goal is to find out a suitable pair of forces F1 and F2 that when applied to the object together with F0 are capable of producing a stable grasp.\nTo achieve this, the forces need to point inward and guarantee that Newton's first law is satisfied both for linear and rotational motion.\nFurther, to prevent slippage, F1 and F2 are requested to lie within their friction cones.\n👉 Think of F0, F1 and F2 as the solution of a 2D planar grasp problem with a 3 fingers gripper, where the force applied by one finger (i.e. F0) is already determined.\nProblem Settings\nThe object's perimeter is contained in the x-y plane and is parmetrized in terms of the angular position t specified in radians. Moreover, the Problem API provides you with the suitable routines to retrieve the point P, the normal N and the tangent T as function of the parameter t (Figure 2). Also, the API gives you the derivatives of such quantities with respect to t.\n⚠ Be careful that N(t) and T(t) are NOT unit vectors.\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, with these settings, a Force can be described by the triplet <t,fn,ft>, where:\n\nt accounts for the angular position where the force is applied.\nfn specifies the amount of force applied along N(t).\nft specifies the amount of force applied along T(t).\n\nPhysics in the 2D World\nThe assumption of a 2D world helps simplify the Problem settings such that a force boils down to a 2D vector in the x-y plane, whereas a torque can be represented\nwith only a scalar along the z axis. In detail, we can take advantage of the class yarp::sig::Vector and\nthe utilities defined in yarp/math/Math.h to deal with the required linear algebra (e.g. summation of vectors, dot and cross products).\nThe net force Ftot and net torque Ttot can be readily obtained by recruiting Netwon's law:\n// F0 relative quantities\nproblem_ns::Force F0 = problem.get_F();\nyarp::sig::Vector P0 = problem.get_P(F0.t);\nyarp::sig::Vector N0 = problem.get_N(F0.t);\nyarp::sig::Vector T0 = problem.get_T(F0.t);\n\n// F1 and F2 are to be provided\nproblem_ns::Force F1, F2;\n// retrieve P1,N1,T1 and P2,N2,T2 analogously\n\n// linear (x,y axes)\nyarp::sig::Vector Ftot = F0.fn*N0 + F1.fn*N1 + F2.fn*N2 + F0.ft*T0 + F1.ft*T1 + F2.ft*T2;\n\n// Center Of Mass of the object\nyarp::sig::Vector COM = problem.get_COM();\n\n// rotation (z-axis): only the third component of the cross product is nonzero\ndouble Ttot = (P0-COM)[0] * (F0.fn*N0[1] + F0.ft*T0[1]) - (P0-COM)[1] * (F0.fn*N0[0] + F0.ft*T0[0]) +\n              (P1-COM)[0] * (F1.fn*N1[1] + F1.ft*T1[1]) - (P1-COM)[1] * (F1.fn*N1[0] + F1.ft*T1[0]) +\n              (P2-COM)[0] * (F2.fn*N2[1] + F2.ft*T2[1]) - (P2-COM)[1] * (F2.fn*N2[0] + F2.ft*T2[0]);\n\n🔘 Click to get more details on the cross product\n\nThe torque is the vector resulting from the cross product between the vector representing the application point of the force and the force itself. In the Newtonian dynamics it is convenient to express such quantities in the frame attached to the center of mass.\n\n\n\nDealing with Friction Cones\nWe recall that a Force F does not cause slippage only if |F.ft| ≤ μ·|F.fn|, where μ is the static friction coefficient of the object.\nThis can be coded in the following snippet:\nproblem_ns::Force F;\n\n// explicit check\nbool no_slippage_explicit = (fabs(F.ft) < problem.get_friction() * fabs(F.fn));\n\n// check through API\nbool no_slippage_api = problem.check_no_slippage(F);\nCode Structure\nThe relevant code structure is reported below:\nassignment_optimization-2Dgrasp\n├── CMakeLists.txt                  # To build the library and the main code\n├── lib                             # Code library\n│\xa0\xa0 ├── problem.h                   # Definition of Problem API\n│\xa0\xa0 ├── problem.cpp                 # Problem implementation\n│\xa0\xa0 ├── solver.h                    # Definition of Solver API\n│\xa0\xa0 └── solver.cpp                  # Your implementation of the Solver (YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT THE CONTENT OF THIS FILE)\n├── scripts\n│\xa0\xa0 └── plot_2Dgrasp-problem.m      # Generate a graphical representation of the Problem settings along with your solution\n├── smoke-test\n│\xa0\xa0 ├── test.sh                     # Run the complete test suite \n└── src\n    └── main.cpp                    # Main code to test your implementation\n📝 You are asked to develop within the file lib/solver.cpp the solution that exploits the nonlinear constrained optimization package Ipopt.\nThe library is documented online 🌐\nBuild the Code\n$ cd assignment_optimization-2Dgrasp\n$ mkdir -p build && cd build\n$ cmake ..\n$ make install\nTest the Code\n\nTo test your solution against an object whose perimeter is a perfect circle do:\n$ assignment_optimization-2Dgrasp --shape circle\n\nTo test your solution against an object whose perimeter is an irregular patch do:\n$ assignment_optimization-2Dgrasp --shape patch\n\nIn both cases, the outcome can be conveniently displayed this way:\n$ plot_2Dgrasp-problem problem.out\nThen, open up the file problem.out.png. Figure 3 illustrates a typical outcome.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you deem you're ready to go, you can accept the challenge of the grading test suite by doing:\n$ cd assignment_optimization-2Dgrasp/smoke-test\n$ ./test.sh\n\n🔘 Click to show how the grading system will assign you score\n\nThe test suite will perform two consecutive verifications:\n\nA Problem with an object whose shape is a perfect cirlce is generated 100 times and checks are done to verify the grasp stability of your solution.\nThe force F0 is always set normal to the perimeter.\nA Problem with an object whose shape is a irregular patch is generated 100 times and checks are done to verify the grasp stability of your solution.\nThe force F0 can be generically oriented inward within its friction cone.\n\nThe score is then computed statistically over the 100 trials according to the following requirements.\nR1. Requirements to satisfy with a circle-shaped object\n\nLinear stability. The net force F shall be in norm smaller than 0.01: 100% of success rate amounts to 4 points.\nRotational stability. The torque T shall be in norm smaller than 0.01: 100% of success rate amounts to 4 points.\nNo slippage. The two forces provided by your algorithm shall be contained within the friction cones to prevent slippage: 100% of success rate amounts to 4 points.\n\nR2. Requirements to satisfy with a patch-shaped object\n\nSame as R1 but with a bonus 🌟 If success_rate(R2.{1,2,3}) ≥ 98%, then you will get the corresponding points doubled.\n\nScore Map\n\n\n\nRequirements\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nR1.1\n0 … 4\n\n\nR1.2\n0 … 4\n\n\nR1.3\n0 … 4\n\n\nR2.1\n0 … 8\n\n\nR2.2\n0 … 8\n\n\nR2.3\n0 … 8\n\n\n\nThe maximum score you can achieve is therefore 36 🏆\n\n\nIncremental Approach\nWe recommend that you tackle the assignment incrementally:\n\nFirst, peruse the solution we provided for the case where we handle only normal forces and we neglect torques. Therefore, grasp stability can be attained only for linear motion.\nThen, extend the solution in order to incorporate Newton's first law also for rotational motion.\nFinally, consider friction cones and thus deal with tangential components of the forces, while avoiding slippage.\n\nHow to complete the assignment\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/vvv-school', 'info_list': ['2', 'CMake', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Oct 11, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 13, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 20, 2021', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 15, 2020', 'CMake', 'Updated Mar 2, 2020', 'Java', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 12, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 19, 2020']}","{'location': 'Colombia', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '921 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Artificial Intelligence Udacity course\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/MikeS96', 'info_list': ['2', 'CMake', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Oct 11, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 13, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 20, 2021', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 15, 2020', 'CMake', 'Updated Mar 2, 2020', 'Java', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 12, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 19, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '104 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['RobotBar\nRobotic Bar\nPositions:\nRUM: 0\nJACK: 8750\nCOKE: 17600\nLEMONADE: 26600\nDrink Home Positon: 4000\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Tmacmannis', 'info_list': ['2', 'CMake', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Oct 11, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 13, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 20, 2021', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 15, 2020', 'CMake', 'Updated Mar 2, 2020', 'Java', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 12, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 19, 2020']}","{'location': 'Pune', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '21 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.\nAvailable Scripts\nIn the project directory, you can run:\nnpm start\nRuns the app in the development mode.\nOpen http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.\nThe page will reload if you make edits.\nYou will also see any lint errors in the console.\nnpm test\nLaunches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\nSee the section about running tests for more information.\nnpm run build\nBuilds the app for production to the build folder.\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\nYour app is ready to be deployed!\nSee the section about deployment for more information.\nnpm run eject\nNote: this is a one-way operation.

Teams who are competing in the SKYSTONE Challenge should use this new SKYSTONE repository instead of the older (and no longer updated) ftc_app repository.\nWelcome!\nThis GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a FIRST Tech Challenge competition robot.  To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.\nGetting Started\nIf you are new to robotics or new to the FIRST Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the FTC Blocks Tutorial to get familiar with how to use the control system:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0FTC Blocks Online Tutorial\nEven if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the FTC Blocks tutorial, and then migrate to the OnBot Java Tool or to Android Studio afterwards.\nDownloading the Project\nIf you are an Android Studio programmer, there are several ways to download this repo.  Note that if you use the Blocks or OnBot Java Tool to program your robot, then you do not need to download this repository.\n\nIf you are a git user, you can clone the most current version of the repository:\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0git clone https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE.git\n\n\nOr, if you prefer, you can use the ""Download Zip"" button available through the main repository page.  Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.\n\n\nYou can also download the project folder (as a .zip or .tar.gz archive file) from the Downloads subsection of the Releases page for this repository.\n\n\nOnce you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder  (""Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)"").\nGetting Help\nUser Documentation and Tutorials\nFIRST maintains online documentation with information and tutorials on how to use the FIRST Tech Challenge software and robot control system.  You can access this documentation using the following link:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0SKYSTONE Online Documentation\nNote that the online documentation is an ""evergreen"" document that is constantly being updated and edited.  It contains the most current information about the FIRST Tech Challenge software and control system.\nJavadoc Reference Material\nThe Javadoc reference documentation for the FTC SDK is now available online.  Click on the following link to view the FTC SDK Javadoc documentation as a live website:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0FTC Javadoc Documentation\nDocumentation for the FTC SDK is also included with this repository.  There is a subfolder called ""doc"" which contains several subfolders:\n\nThe folder ""apk"" contains the .apk files for the FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps.\nThe folder ""javadoc"" contains the JavaDoc user documentation for the FTC SDK.\n\nOnline User Forum\nFor technical questions regarding the Control System or the FTC SDK, please visit the FTC Technology forum:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0FTC Technology Forum\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.4 (20200108-101156)\n\nFixes SkyStone issue #88\nAdds an inspection item that notes when a robot controller (Control Hub) is using the factory default password.\nFixes SkyStone issue #61\nFixes SkyStone issue #142\nFixes ftc_app issue #417 by adding more current and voltage monitoring capabilities for REV Hubs.\nFixes a crash sometimes caused by OnBotJava activity\nImproves OnBotJava autosave functionality ftc_app #738\nFixes system responsiveness issue when an Expansion Hub is disconnected\nFixes issue where IMU initialization could prevent Op Modes from stopping\nFixes issue where AndroidTextToSpeech.speak() would fail if it was called too early\nAdds telemetry.speak() methods and blocks, which cause the Driver Station (if also updated) to speak text\nAdds and improves Expansion Hub-related warnings\n\nImproves Expansion Hub low battery warning\n\nDisplays the warning immediately after the hub reports it\nSpecifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run\nDisplays which hubs reported low battery\n\n\nDisplays warning when hub loses and regains power during an OpMode run\n\nFixes the hub\'s LED pattern after this condition\n\n\nDisplays warning when Expansion Hub is not responding to commands\n\nSpecifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run\n\n\nClarifies warning when Expansion Hub is not present at startup\n\nSpecifies that this condition requires a Robot Restart before the hub can be used.\nThe hub light will now accurately reflect this state\n\n\nImproves logging and reduces log spam during these conditions\n\n\nSyncs the Control Hub time and timezone to a connected web browser programming the robot, if a Driver Station is not available.\nAdds bulk read functionality for REV Hubs\n\nA bulk caching mode must be set at the Hub level with LynxModule#setBulkCachingMode(). This applies to all relevant SDK hardware classes that reference that Hub.\nThe following following Hub bulk caching modes are available:\n\nBulkCachingMode.OFF (default): All hardware calls operate as usual. Bulk data can read through LynxModule#getBulkData() and processed manually.\nBulkCachingMode.AUTO: Applicable hardware calls are served from a bulk read cache that is cleared/refreshed automatically to ensure identical commands don\'t hit the same cache. The cache can also be cleared manually with LynxModule#clearBulkCache(), although this is not recommended.\n(advanced users) BulkCachingMode.MANUAL: Same as BulkCachingMode.AUTO except the cache is never cleared automatically. To avoid getting stale data, the cache must be manually cleared at the beginning of each loop body or as the user deems appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nRemoves PIDF Annotation values added in Rev 5.3 (to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations).\n\nThe new motor types will still be available but their Default control behavior will revert back to Rev 5.2\n\n\nAdds new ConceptMotorBulkRead sample Opmode to demonstrate and compare Motor Bulk-Read modes for reducing I/O latencies.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.3 (20191004-112306)\n\nFixes external USB/UVC webcam support\nMakes various bugfixes and improvements to Blocks page, including but not limited to:\n\nMany visual tweaks\nBrowser zoom and window resize behave better\nResizing the Java preview pane works better and more consistently across browsers\nThe Java preview pane consistently gets scrollbars when needed\nThe Java preview pane is hidden by default on phones\nInternet Explorer 11 should work\nLarge dropdown lists display properly on lower res screens\nDisabled buttons are now visually identifiable as disabled\nA warning is shown if a user selects a TFOD sample, but their device is not compatible\nWarning messages in a Blocks op mode are now visible by default.\n\n\nAdds goBILDA 5201 and 5202 motors to Robot Configurator\nAdds PIDF Annotation values to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations.\nThis has the effect of causing the RUN_USING_ENCODERS and RUN_TO_POSITION modes to use\nPIDF vs PID closed loop control on these motors.  This should provide more responsive, yet stable, speed control.\nPIDF adds Feedforward control to the basic PID control loop.\nFeedforward is useful when controlling a motor\'s speed because it ""anticipates"" how much the control voltage\nmust change to achieve a new speed set-point, rather than requiring the integrated error to change sufficiently.\nThe PIDF values were chosen to provide responsive, yet stable, speed control on a lightly loaded motor.\nThe more heavily a motor is loaded (drag or friction), the more noticable the PIDF improvement will be.\nFixes startup crash on Android 10\nFixes ftc_app issue #712 (thanks to FROGbots-4634)\nFixes ftc_app issue #542\nAllows ""A"" and lowercase letters when naming device through RC and DS apps.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.2 (20190905-083277)\n\nFixes extra-wide margins on settings activities, and placement of the new configuration button\nAdds Skystone Vuforia image target data.\n\nIncludes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Java).\nIncludes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Blocks).\n\n\nAdds TensorFlow inference model (.tflite) for Skystone game elements.\n\nIncludes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Java).\nIncludes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Blocks).\n\n\nRemoves older (season-specific) sample op modes.\nIncludes 64-bit support (to comply with Google Play requirements).\nProtects against Stuck OpModes when a Restart Robot is requested. (Thanks to FROGbots-4634) (ftc_app issue #709)\nBlocks related changes:\n\nFixes bug with blocks generated code when hardware device name is a java or javascript reserved word.\nShows generated java code for blocks, even when hardware items are missing from the active configuration.\nDisplays warning icon when outdated Vuforia and TensorFlow blocks are used (SkyStone issue #27)\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.1 (20190820-222104)\n\nDefines default PIDF parameters for the following motors:\n\nREV Core Hex Motor\nREV 20:1 HD Hex Motor\nREV 40:1 HD Hex Motor\n\n\nAdds back button when running on a device without a system back button (such as a Control Hub)\nAllows a REV Control Hub to update the firmware on a REV Expansion Hub via USB\nFixes SkyStone issue #9\nFixes ftc_app issue #715\nPrevents extra DS User clicks by filtering based on current state.\nPrevents incorrect DS UI state changes when receiving new OpMode list from RC\nAdds support for REV Color Sensor V3\nAdds a manual-refresh DS Camera Stream for remotely viewing RC camera frames.\n\nTo show the stream on the DS, initialize but do not run a stream-enabled opmode, select the Camera Stream option in the DS menu, and tap the image to refresh. This feature is automatically enabled when using Vuforia or TFOD—no additional RC configuration is required for typical use cases. To hide the stream, select the same menu item again.\nNote that gamepads are disabled and the selected opmode cannot be started while the stream is open as a safety precaution.\nTo use custom streams, consult the API docs for CameraStreamServer#setSource and CameraStreamSource.\n\n\nAdds many Star Wars sounds to RobotController resources.\nAdded SKYSTONE Sounds Chooser Sample Program.\nSwitches out startup, connect chimes, and error/warning sounds for Star Wars sounds\nUpdates OnBot Java to use a WebSocket for communication with the robot\n\nThe OnBot Java page no longer has to do a full refresh when a user switches from editing one file to another\n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nCamera Stream\n\nThe Vuforia camera stream inherits the issues present in the phone preview (namely ftc_app issue #574). This problem does not affect the TFOD camera stream even though it receives frames from Vuforia.\nThe orientation of the stream frames may not always match the phone preview. For now, these frames may be rotated manually via a custom CameraStreamSource if desired.\n\n\nOnBotJava\n\nBrowser back button may not always work correctly\nIt\'s possible for a build to be queued, but not started. The OnBot Java build console will display a warning if this occurs.\nA user might not realize they are editing a different file if the user inadvertently switches from one file to another since this switch is now seamless. The name of the currently open file is displayed in the browser tab.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.0 (built on 19.06.14)\n\nSupport for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\nAdds a Java preview pane to the Blocks editor.\nAdds a new offline export feature to the Blocks editor.\nDisplay wifi channel in Network circle on Driver Station.\nAdds calibration for Logitech C270\nUpdates build tooling and target SDK.\nCompliance with Google\'s permissions infrastructure (Required after build tooling update).\nKeep Alives to mitigate the Motorola wifi scanning problem.  Telemetry substitute no longer necessary.\nImproves Vuforia error reporting.\nFixes ftctechnh/ftc_app issues 621, 713.\nMiscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.3 (built on 18.10.31)\n\nIncludes missing TensorFlow-related libraries and files.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.2 (built on 18.10.30)\n\nIncludes fix to avoid deadlock situation with WatchdogMonitor which could result in USB communication errors.\n\nComm error appeared to require that user disconnect USB cable and restart the Robot Controller app to recover.\nrobotControllerLog.txt would have error messages that included the words ""E RobotCore: lynx xmit lock: #### abandoning lock:""\n\n\nIncludes fix to correctly list the parent module address for a REV Robotics Expansion Hub in a configuration (.xml) file.\n\nBug in versions 4.0 and 4.1 would incorrect list the address module for a parent REV Robotics device as ""1"".\nIf the parent module had a higher address value than the daisy-chained module, then this bug would prevent the Robot Controller from communicating with the downstream Expansion Hub.\n\n\nAdded requirement for ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION to allow a Driver Station running Android Oreo to scan for Wi-Fi Direct devices.\nAdded google() repo to build.gradle because aapt2 must be downloaded from the google() repository beginning with version 3.2 of the Android Gradle Plugin.\n\nImportant Note: Android Studio users will need to be connected to the Internet the first time build the ftc_app project.\nInternet connectivity is required for the first build so the appropriate files can be downloaded from the Google repository.\nUsers should not need to be connected to the Internet for subsequent builds.\nThis should also fix buid issue where Android Studio would complain that it ""Could not find com.android.tools.lint:lint-gradle:26.1.4"" (or similar).\n\n\nAdded support for REV Spark Mini motor controller as part of the configuration menu for a servo/PWM port on the REV Expansion Hub.\nProvide examples for playing audio files in an Op Mode.\nBlock Development Tool Changes\n\nIncludes a fix for a problem with the Velocity blocks that were reported in the FTC Technology forum (Blocks Programming subforum).\nChange the ""Save completed successfully."" message to a white color so it will contrast with a green background.\nFixed the ""Download image"" feature so it will work if there are text blocks in the op mode.\n\n\nIntroduce support for Google\'s TensorFlow Lite technology for object detetion for 2018-2019 game.\n\nTensorFlow lite can recognize Gold Mineral and Silver Mineral from 2018-2019 game.\nExample Java and Block op modes are included to show how to determine the relative position of the gold block (left, center, right).\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.1 (released on 18.09.24)\nChanges include:\n\nFix to prevent crash when deprecated configuration annotations are used.\nChange to allow FTC Robot Controller APK to be auto-updated using FIRST Global Control Hub update scripts.\nRemoved samples for non supported / non legal hardware.\nImprovements to Telemetry.addData block with ""text"" socket.\nUpdated Blocks sample op mode list to include Rover Ruckus Vuforia example.\nUpdate SDK library version number.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.0 (released on 18.09.12)\nChanges include:\n\n\nInitial support for UVC compatible cameras\n\nIf UVC camera has a unique serial number, RC will detect and enumerate by serial number.\nIf UVC camera lacks a unique serial number, RC will only support one camera of that type connected.\nCalibration settings for a few cameras are included (see

current from the USB bus.\n\nThis does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n\n\n\n\nThis does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.\nFTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.\n\n\nUpdated sample Vuforia Navigation and VuMark Op Modes to demonstrate how to use an internal phone-based camera and an external UVC webcam.\n\n\n\nSupport for improved motor control.\n\nREV Robotics Expansion Hub firmware 1.8 and greater will support a feed forward mechanism for closed loop motor control.\nFTC SDK has been modified to support PIDF coefficients (proportional, integral, derivative, and feed forward).\nFTC Blocks development tool modified to include PIDF programming blocks.\nDeprecated older PID-related methods and variables.\nREV\'s 1.8.x PIDF-related changes provide a more linear and accurate way to control a motor.\n\n\n\nWireless\n\nAdded 5GHz support for wireless channel changing for those devices that support it.\n\nTested with Moto G5 and E4 phones.\n\n\n\n\nAlso tested with other (currently non-approved) phones such as Samsung Galaxy S8.\n\n\n\nImproved Expansion Hub firmware update support in Robot Controller app\n\nChanges to make the system more robust during the firmware update process (when performed through Robot Controller app).\nUser no longer has to disconnect a downstream daisy-chained Expansion Hub when updating an Expansion Hub\'s firmware.\n\nIf user is updating an Expansion Hub\'s firmware through a USB connection, he/she does not have to disconnect RS485 connection to other Expansion Hubs.\n\n\n\n\nThe user still must use a USB connection to update an Expansion Hub\'s firmware.\nThe user cannot update the Expansion Hub firmware for a downstream device that is daisy chained through an RS485 connection.\n\n\nIf an Expansion Hub accidentally gets ""bricked"" the Robot Controller app is now more likely to recognize the Hub when it scans the USB bus.\n\nRobot Controller app should be able to detect an Expansion Hub, even if it accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.\n\n\n\n\nRobot Controller app should be able to install the firmware onto the Hub, even if if accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.\n\n\n\nResiliency\n\nFTC software can detect and enable an FTDI reset feature that is available with REV Robotics v1.8 Expansion Hub firmware and greater.\n\nWhen enabled, the Expansion Hub can detect if it hasn\'t communicated with the Robot Controller over the FTDI (USB) connection.\n\n\n\n\nIf the Hub hasn\'t heard from the Robot Controller in a while, it will reset the FTDI connection.\nThis action helps system recover from some ESD-induced disruptions.\n\n\nVarious fixes to improve reliability of FTC software.\n\n\n\nBlocks\n\nFixed errors with string and list indices in blocks export to java.\nSupport for USB connected UVC webcams.\nRefactored optimized Blocks Vuforia code to support Rover Ruckus image targets.\nAdded programming blocks to support PIDF

present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n\n\n\n\nThis does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.\nFTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.\n\n\nThere might be a possible deadlock which causes the RC to become unresponsive when using a UVC webcam with a Nougat Android Robot Controller.\n\n\n\nWireless\n\nWhen user selects a wireless channel, this channel does not necessarily persist if the phone is power cycled.\n\nTech Team is hoping to eventually address this issue in a future release.\n\n\n\n\nIssue has been present since apps were introduced (i.e., it is not new with the v4.0 release).\n\n\nWireless channel is not currently displayed for WiFi Direct connections.\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe blink indication feature that shows which Expansion Hub is currently being configured does not work for a newly created configuration file.\n\nUser has to first save a newly created configuration file and then close and re-edit the file in order for blink indicator to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 3.6 (built on 17.12.18)\nChanges include:\n\nBlocks Changes\n\nUses updated Google Blockly software to allow users to edit their op modes on Apple iOS devices (including iPad and iPhone).\nImprovement in Blocks

for user rendering of frames\n\nAdded a user-overrideable onRenderFrame() method which gets called by the class\'s renderFrame() method.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 3.5 (built on 17.10.30)\nChanges with version 3.5 include:\n\nIntroduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which can occur after the Robot Controller app has been paused and then resumed (for example, when a user temporarily turns off the display of the Robot Controller phone, and then turns the screen back on).\nIntroduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which were previously caused by random peer disconnect events on the Driver Station.\nFixes issue where log files would be closed on pause of the RC or DS, but not re-opened upon resume.\nFixes issue with battery handler (voltage) start/stop race.\nFixes issue where Android Studio generated op modes would disappear from available list in certain situations.\nFixes problem where OnBot Java would not build on REV Robotics Control

software includes improves for the FTC Blocks Programming Tool and the OnBot Java Programming Tool.\nChanges with verion 3.3 include:\n\nAndroid Studio ftc_app project has been updated to use Gradle Plugin 2.3.3.\nAndroid Studio ftc_app project is already using gradle 3.5 distribution.\nRobot Controller log has been renamed to /sdcard/RobotControllerLog.txt (note that this change was actually introduced w/ v3.2).\nImprovements in I2C reliability.\nOptimized I2C read for REV Expansion Hub, with v1.7 firmware or greater.\nUpdated all external/samples (available through OnBot and in Android project folder).\nVuforia\n\nAdded support for VuMarks that will be used for the 2017-2018 season game.\n\n\nBlocks\n\nUpdate to latest Google Blockly release.\nSample op modes can be selected as a

v3.3 Android Studio project folder, if you get error messages indicating ""InvalidVirtualFileAccessException"" then you might need to do a File->Invalidate Caches / Restart to clear the error.\n\n\nOnBot Java\n\nSometimes when you push the build button to build all op modes, the RC returns an error message that the build failed.  If you press the build button a second time, the build typically suceeds.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 3.2 (built on 17.08.02)\nThis version of the software introduces the ""OnBot Java"" Development Tool.  Similar to the FTC Blocks Development Tool, the FTC OnBot Java Development Tool allows a user to create, edit and build op modes dynamically using only a Javascript-enabled web browser.\nThe OnBot Java Development Tool is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is served up by the Robot Controller.  Op modes are created and edited using a Javascript-enabled browser (Google Chromse is recommended).  Op modes are saved on the Robot Controller Android device directly.\nThe OnBot Java Development Tool provides a Java programming environment that does NOT need Android Studio.\nChanges with version 3.2 include:\n\n\nEnhanced web-based development tools\n\nIntroduction of OnBot Java Development Tool.\nWeb-based programming and management features are ""always on"" (user no longer needs to put Robot Controller into programming mode).\nWeb-based management interface (where user can change Robot Controller name and also easily download Robot Controller log file).\nOnBot Java, Blocks and Management features available from web based interface.\n\n\n\nBlocks Programming Development Tool:\n\nChanged ""LynxI2cColorRangeSensor"" block to ""REV Color/range sensor"" block.\nFixed tooltip for ColorSensor.isLightOn block.\nAdded blocks for ColorSensor.getNormalizedColors and LynxI2cColorRangeSensor.getNormalizedColors.\n\n\n\nAdded example op modes for digital touch sensor and REV Robotics Color Distance sensor.\n\n\nUser selectable color themes.\n\n\nIncludes many minor enhancements and fixes (too numerous to list).\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nAuto complete function is incomplete and does not support the following (for now):\n\nAccess via this keyword\nAccess via super keyword\nMembers of the super cloass, not overridden by the class\nAny methods provided in the current class\nInner classes\nCan\'t handle casted objects\nAny objects coming from an parenthetically enclosed expression\n\n\n\n\nVersion 3.10 (built on 17.05.09)\nThis version of the software provides support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub.  This version also includes improvements in the USB communication layer in an effort to enhance system resiliency.  If you were using a 2.x version of the software previously, updating to version 3.1 requires that you also update your Driver Station software in addition to updating the Robot Controller software.\nAlso note that in version 3.10 software, the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods are no longer available (not deprecated, they have been removed from the SDK). Also note that the the new 3.x software incorporates motor profiles that a user can select as he/she configures the robot.\nChanges include:\n\nBlocks changes\n\nAdded VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener.getPose and Vuforia.trackPose blocks.\nAdded optimized blocks support for Vuforia extended tracking.\nAdded atan2 block to the math category.\nAdded useCompetitionFieldTargetLocations parameter to Vuforia.initialize block.  If set to false, the target locations are placed at (0,0,0) with target orientation as specified in https://github.com/gearsincorg/FTCVuforiaDemo/blob/master/Robot_Navigation.java tutorial op mode.\n\n\nIncorporates additional improvements to USB comm layer to improve system resiliency (to recover from a greater number of communication disruptions).\n\n\nAdditional Notes Regarding Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)\nIn addition to the release changes listed below (see section labeled ""Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.013)""), version 3.00 has the following important changes:\n\nVersion 3.00 software uses a new version of the FTC Robocol (robot protocol).  If you upgrade to v3.0 on the Robot Controller and/or Android Studio side, you must also upgrade the Driver Station software to match the new Robocol.\nVersion 3.00 software removes the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods from the DcMotor class.  If you have an op mode that formerly used these methods, you will need to remove the references/calls to these methods.  Instead, v3.0 provides the max speed information through the use of motor profiles that are selected by the user during robot configuration.\nVersion 3.00 software currently does not have a mechanism to disable extra i2c sensors.  We hope to re-introduce this function with a release in the near future.\n\n\nVersion 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)\n*** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***\nThis software is being released as an ""alpha"" version.  Use this version at your own risk!\nThis pre-release software contains SIGNIFICANT changes, including changes to the Wi-Fi Direct pairing mechanism, rewrites of the I2C sensor classes, changes to the USB/FTDI layer, and the introduction of support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub and the REV Robotics color-range-light sensor.  These changes were implemented to improve the reliability and resiliency of the FTC control system.\nPlease note, however, that version 3.00 is considered ""alpha"" code.  This code is being released so that the FIRST community will have an opportunity to test the new REV Expansion Hub electronics module when it becomes available in May.  The developers do not recommend using this code for critical applications (i.e., competition use).\n*** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***\nChanges include:\n\nMajor rework of sensor-related infrastructure.

This is important - we no longer set the motor modes through the motor controller.\nsetMode and getMode were added to the DcMotor class.\nContinuousRotationServo class has been added to the FTC SDK.\nRange.clip() method has been overloaded so it can support this operation for int, short and byte integers.\nSome changes have been made (new methods added) on how a user can access items from the hardware map.\nUsers can now set the zero power behavior for a DC motor so that the motor will brake or float when power is zero.\nPrototype Blockly Programming Mode has been added to FTC Robot Controller.  Users can place the Robot Controller into this mode, and then use a device (such as a laptop) that has a Javascript enabled browser to write Blockly-based Op Modes directly onto the Robot Controller.\nUsers can now configure the robot remotely through the FTC Driver Station app.\nAndroid Studio project supports Android Studio 2.1.x and compile SDK Version 23 (Marshmallow).\nVuforia Computer Vision SDK integrated into FTC SDK.  Users can use sample vision targets to get localization information on a standard FTC field.\nProject structure has been reorganized so that there is now a TeamCode package that users can use to place their local/custom Op Modes into this package.\nInspection function has been integrated into the FTC Robot Controller and Driver Station Apps (Thanks Team HazMat… 9277 & 10650!).\nAudio cues have been incorporated into FTC SDK.\nSwap mechanism added to FTC Robot Controller configuration activity.  For example, if you have two motor controllers on a robot, and you misidentified them in your configuration file, you can use the Swap button to swap the devices within the configuration file (so you do not have to manually re-enter in the configuration info for the two devices).\nFix mechanism added to all user to replace an electronic module easily.  For example, suppose a servo controller dies on your robot. You replace the broken module with a new module, which has a different serial number from the original servo controller.  You can use the Fix button to automatically reconfigure your configuration file to use the serial number of the new module.\nImprovements made to fix resiliency and responsiveness of the system.\nFor LinearOpMode the user now must for a telemetry.update() to update the telemetry data on the driver station.  This update() mechanism ensures that the driver station gets the updated data properly and at the same time.\nThe Auto Configure function of the Robot Controller is now template based.  If there is a commonly used robot configuration, a template can be created so that the Auto Configure mechanism can be used to quickly configure a robot of this type.\nThe logic to detect a runaway op mode (both in the LinearOpMode and OpMode types) and to abort the run, then auto recover has been improved/implemented.\nFix has been incorporated so that Logitech F310 gamepad mappings will be correct for Marshmallow users.\n\n\nRelease 16.07.08\n\nFor the ftc_app project, the gradle files have been modified to support Android Studio 2.1.x.\n\n\nRelease 16.03.30\n\nFor the MIT App Inventor, the design blocks have new icons that better represent the function of each design component.\nSome changes were made to the shutdown logic to ensure the robust shutdown of some of our USB services.\nA change was made to LinearOpMode so as to allow a given instance to be executed more than once, which is required for the App Inventor.\nJavadoc improved/updated.\n\n\nRelease 16.03.09\n\nChanges made to make the FTC SDK synchronous (significant change!)\n\nwaitOneFullHardwareCycle() and waitForNextHardwareCycle() are no longer needed and have been deprecated.\nrunOpMode() (for a LinearOpMode) is now decoupled from the system\'s hardware read/write thread.\nloop() (for an OpMode) is now decoupled from the system\'s hardware read/write thread.\nMethods are synchronous.\nFor example, if you call setMode(DcMotorController.RunMode.RESET_ENCODERS) for a motor, the encoder is guaranteed to be reset when the method call is complete.\nFor legacy module (NXT compatible), user no longer has to toggle between read and write modes when reading from or writing to a legacy device.\n\n\nChanges made to enhance reliability/robustness during ESD event.\nChanges made to make code thread safe.\nDebug keystore added so that user-generated robot controller APKs will all use the same signed key (to avoid conflicts if a team has multiple developer laptops for example).\nFirmware version information for Modern Robotics modules are now logged.\nChanges made to improve USB comm reliability and robustness.\nAdded support for voltage indicator for legacy (NXT-compatible) motor controllers.\nChanges made to provide auto stop capabilities for op modes.\n\nA LinearOpMode class will stop when the statements in runOpMode() are complete.  User does not have to push the stop button on the driver station.\nIf an op mode is stopped by the driver station, but there is a run away/uninterruptible thread persisting, the app will log an error message then force itself to crash to stop the runaway thread.\n\n\nDriver Station UI modified to display lowest measured voltage below current voltage (12V battery).\nDriver Station UI modified to have color background for current voltage (green=good, yellow=caution, red=danger, extremely low voltage).\njavadoc improved (edits and additional classes).\nAdded app build time to About activity for driver station and robot controller apps.\nDisplay local IP addresses on Driver Station About activity.\nAdded I2cDeviceSynchImpl.\nAdded I2cDeviceSync interface.\nAdded seconds() and milliseconds() to ElapsedTime for clarity.\nAdded getCallbackCount() to I2cDevice.\nAdded missing clearI2cPortActionFlag.\nAdded code to create log messages while waiting for LinearOpMode shutdown.\nFix so Wifi Direct Config activity will no longer launch multiple times.\nAdded the ability to specify an alternate i2c address in software for the Modern Robotics gyro.\n\n\nRelease 16.02.09\n\nImproved battery checker feature so that voltage values get refreshed regularly (every 250 msec) on Driver Station (DS) user interface.\nImproved software so that Robot Controller (RC) is much more resilient and “self-healing” to USB disconnects:\n\nIf user attempts to start/restart RC with one or more module missing, it will display a warning but still start up.\nWhen running an op mode, if one or more modules gets disconnected, the RC & DS will display warnings,and robot will keep on working in spite of the missing module(s).\nIf a disconnected module gets physically reconnected the RC will auto detect the module and the user will regain control of the recently connected module.\nWarning messages are more helpful (identifies the type of module that’s missing plus its USB serial number).\n\n\nCode changes to fix the null gamepad reference when users try to reference the gamepads in the init() portion of their op mode.\nNXT light sensor output is now properly scaled.  Note that teams might have to readjust their light threshold values in their op modes.\nOn DS user interface, gamepad icon for a driver will disappear if the matching gamepad is disconnected or if that gamepad gets designated as a different driver.\nRobot Protocol (ROBOCOL) version number info is displayed in About screen on RC and DS apps.\nIncorporated a display filter on pairing screen to filter out devices that don’t use the “-“ format. This filter can be turned off to show all WiFi Direct devices.\nUpdated text in License file.\nFixed formatting error in OpticalDistanceSensor.toString().\nFixed issue on with a blank (“”) device name that would disrupt WiFi Direct Pairing.\nMade a change so that the WiFi info and battery info can be displayed more quickly on the DS upon connecting to RC.\nImproved javadoc generation.\nModified code to make it easier to support language localization in the future.\n\n\nRelease 16.01.04\n\nUpdated compileSdkVersion for apps\nPrevent Wifi from entering power saving mode\nremoved unused import from driver station\nCorrrected ""Dead zone"" joystick code.\nLED.getDeviceName and .getConnectionInfo() return null\napps check for ROBOCOL_VERSION mismatch\nFix for Telemetry also has off-by-one errors in its data string sizing / short size limitations error\nUser telemetry output is sorted.\nadded formatting variants to DbgLog and RobotLog APIs\ncode modified to allow for a long list of op mode names.\nchanges to improve thread safety of RobocolDatagramSocket\nFix for ""missing hardware leaves robot controller disconnected from driver station"" error\nfix for ""fast tapping of Init/Start causes problems"" (toast is now only instantiated on UI thread).\nadded some log statements for thread life cycle.\nmoved gamepad reset logic inside of initActiveOpMode() for robustness\nchanges made to mitigate risk of race conditions on public methods.\nchanges to try and flag when WiFi Direct name contains non-printable characters.\nfix to correct race condition between .run() and .close() in ReadWriteRunnableStandard.\nupdated FTDI driver\nmade ReadWriteRunnableStanard interface public.\nfixed off-by-one errors in Command constructor\nmoved specific hardware implmentations into their own package.\nmoved specific gamepad implemnatations to the hardware library.\nchanged LICENSE file to new BSD version.\nfixed race condition when shutting down Modern Robotics USB devices.\nmethods in the ColorSensor classes have been synchronized.\ncorrected isBusy() status to reflect end of motion.\ncorrected ""back"" button keycode.\nthe notSupported() method of the GyroSensor class was changed to protected (it should not be public).\n\n\nRelease 15.11.04.001\n\nAdded Support for Modern Robotics Gyro.\n\n\nThe GyroSensor class now supports the MR Gyro Sensor.\nUsers can access heading data (about Z axis)\nUsers can also access raw gyro data (X, Y, & Z axes).\nExample MRGyroTest.java op mode included.\n\n\nImproved error messages\n\n\nMore descriptive error messages for exceptions in user code.\n\n\nUpdated DcMotor API\nEnable read mode on new address in setI2cAddress\nFix so that driver station app resets the gamepads when switching op modes.\nUSB-related code changes to make USB comm more responsive and to display more explicit error messages.\n\n\nFix so that USB will recover properly if the USB bus returns garbage data.\nFix USB initializtion race condition.\nBetter error reporting during FTDI open.\nMore explicit messages during USB failures.\nFixed bug so that USB device is closed if event loop teardown method was not called.\n\n\nFixed timer UI issue\nFixed duplicate name UI bug (Legacy Module configuration).\nFixed race condition in EventLoopManager.\nFix to keep references stable when updating gamepad.\nFor legacy Matrix motor/servo controllers removed necessity of appending ""Motor"" and ""Servo"" to controller names.\nUpdated HT color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbLegacyModule class.\nUpdated MR color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbDeviceInterfaceModule class.\nCorrectly handle I2C Address change in all color sensors\nUpdated/cleaned up op modes.\n\n\nUpdated comments in LinearI2cAddressChange.java example op mode.\nReplaced the calls to ""setChannelMode"" with ""setMode"" (to match the new of the DcMotor  method).\nRemoved K9AutoTime.java op mode.\nAdded MRGyroTest.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Gyro Sensor).\nAdded MRRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Color Sensor).\nAdded HTRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use HT legacy color sensor).\nAdded MatrixControllerDemo.java (demonstrates how to use legacy Matrix controller).\n\n\nUpdated javadoc documentation.\nUpdated release .apk files for Robot Controller and Driver Station apps.\n\nT. Eng\nNovember 5, 2015\n\nRelease 15.10.06.002\n\nAdded support for Legacy Matrix 9.6V motor/servo controller.\nCleaned up build.gradle file.\nMinor UI and bug fixes for driver station and robot controller apps.\nThrows error if Ultrasonic sensor (NXT) is not configured for legacy module port 4 or 5.\n\nT. Eng\nOctober 6, 2015\n\nIn this latest version of the FTC SDK (20150803_001) the following changes should be noted:\n\nNew user interfaces for FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps.\nAn init() method is added to the OpMode class.\n\nFor this release, init() is triggered right before the start() method.\nEventually, the init() method will be triggered when the user presses an ""INIT"" button on driver station.\nThe init() and loop() methods are now required (i.e., need to be overridden in the user\'s op mode).\nThe start() and stop() methods are optional.\n\n\nA new LinearOpMode class is introduced.\n\nTeams can use the LinearOpMode mode to create a linear (not event driven) program model.\nTeams can use blocking statements like Thread.sleep() within a linear op mode.\n\n\nThe API for the Legacy Module and Core Device Interface Module have been updated.\n\nSupport for encoders with the Legacy Module is now working.\n\n\nThe hardware loop has been updated for better performance.\n\nT.

It is designed to handle any game design and supports qualification and elimination matches, as well as schedule generation.\nInstallation\nThe releases tab contains the most recent version of the LegoScorer application. It can be run on Windows or MacOS (download your version). If neither of these suits your needs, you can download the source code and build it using JDK14. To repackage this program, I used jlink and jpackage (jdk14+), but for a single computer, you can simply just run the program using your local jdk.\nBasics\nThe program has three menus. When you first open it, you can create a tournament, create a game type, or import a tournament. Tournaments and game types are both saved as data files (.tdat and .gdat), and can be edited manually if required. The first step is to create a game type, modelling the current year's game. The second step is to create a tournament, using the game type as well as a team list. After both of these criteria are met, you can open the tournament itself and edit match data.\nImportant notes\nAll data (.gdat, .tdat) files will be stored in a user's Documents/LegoScorer folder by default. This location can be changed within the LegoScorer program itself, and these files can be transferred between PCs without risk. Once a tournament is created, the game data file is not required, as all the data gets imported into the tournament data file.\nOnce a tournament is created, it creates a linked excel file containing all important data. It will be in the same folder as the tournament file itself, and can be used to update a scoreboard if needed.\nOnce a playoff round is generated, it cannot be removed unless manually removed by editing the .tdat file. An update will resolve this partially. However, generating the next playoffs round (ex. generating semifinals when quarterfinals are not finished) has inherent problems, as re-generating the semifinals after changing quarterfinals scores would delete semifinals scores, and result in match replays.

Teams who are competing in the SKYSTONE Challenge should use this new SKYSTONE repository instead of the older (and no longer updated) ftc_app repository.\nWelcome!\nThis GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a FIRST Tech Challenge competition robot.  To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.\nGetting Started\nIf you are new to robotics or new to the FIRST Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the FTC Blocks Tutorial to get familiar with how to use the control system:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0FTC Blocks Online Tutorial\nEven if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the FTC Blocks tutorial, and then migrate to the OnBot Java Tool or to Android Studio afterwards.\nDownloading the Project\nIf you are an Android Studio programmer, there are several ways to download this repo.  Note that if you use the Blocks or OnBot Java Tool to program your robot, then you do not need to download this repository.\n\nIf you are a git user, you can clone the most current version of the repository:\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0git clone https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE.git\n\n\nOr, if you prefer, you can use the ""Download Zip"" button available through the main repository page.  Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.\n\n\nYou can also download the project folder (as a .zip or .tar.gz archive file) from the Downloads subsection of the Releases page for this repository.\n\n\nOnce you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder  (""Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)"").\nGetting Help\nUser Documentation and Tutorials\nFIRST maintains online documentation with information and tutorials on how to use the FIRST Tech Challenge software and robot control system.  You can access this documentation using the following link:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0SKYSTONE Online Documentation\nNote that the online documentation is an ""evergreen"" document that is constantly being updated and edited.  It contains the most current information about the FIRST Tech Challenge software and control system.\nJavadoc Reference Material\nThe Javadoc reference documentation for the FTC SDK is now available online.  Click on the following link to view the FTC SDK Javadoc documentation as a live website:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0FTC Javadoc Documentation\nDocumentation for the FTC SDK is also included with this repository.  There is a subfolder called ""doc"" which contains several subfolders:\n\nThe folder ""apk"" contains the .apk files for the FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps.\nThe folder ""javadoc"" contains the JavaDoc user documentation for the FTC SDK.\n\nOnline User Forum\nFor technical questions regarding the Control System or the FTC SDK, please visit the FTC Technology forum:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0FTC Technology Forum\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.2 (20190905-083227)\n\nFixes extra-wide margins on settings activities, and placement of the new configuration button\nAdds Skystone Vuforia image target data.\n\nIncludes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Java).\nIncludes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Blocks).\n\n\nAdds TensorFlow inference model (.tflite) for Skystone game elements.\n\nIncludes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Java).\nIncludes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Blocks).\n\n\nRemoves older (season-specific) sample op modes.\nIncludes 64-bit support (to comply with Google Play requirements).\nProtects against Stuck OpModes when a Restart Robot is requested. (Thanks to FROGbots-4634) (ftc_app issue #709)\nBlocks related changes:\n\nFixes bug with blocks generated code when hardware device name is a java or javascript reserved word.\nShows generated java code for blocks, even when hardware items are missing from the active configuration.\nDisplays warning icon when outdated Vuforia and TensorFlow blocks are used (SkyStone issue #27)\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.1 (20190820-222104)\n\nDefines default PIDF parameters for the following motors:\n\nREV Core Hex Motor\nREV 20:1 HD Hex Motor\nREV 40:1 HD Hex Motor\n\n\nAdds back button when running on a device without a system back button (such as a Control Hub)\nAllows a REV Control Hub to update the firmware on a REV Expansion Hub via USB\nFixes SkyStone issue #9\nFixes ftc_app issue #715\nPrevents extra DS User clicks by filtering based on current state.\nPrevents incorrect DS UI state changes when receiving new OpMode list from RC\nAdds support for REV Color Sensor V3\nAdds a manual-refresh DS Camera Stream for remotely viewing RC camera frames.\n\nTo show the stream on the DS, initialize but do not run a stream-enabled opmode, select the Camera Stream option in the DS menu, and tap the image to refresh. This feature is automatically enabled when using Vuforia or TFOD—no additional RC configuration is required for typical use cases. To hide the stream, select the same menu item again.\nNote that gamepads are disabled and the selected opmode cannot be started while the stream is open as a safety precaution.\nTo use custom streams, consult the API docs for CameraStreamServer#setSource and CameraStreamSource.\n\n\nAdds many Star Wars sounds to RobotController resources.\nAdded SKYSTONE Sounds Chooser Sample Program.\nSwitches out startup, connect chimes, and error/warning sounds for Star Wars sounds\nUpdates OnBot Java to use a WebSocket for communication with the robot\n\nThe OnBot Java page no longer has to do a full refresh when a user switches from editing one file to another\n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nCamera Stream\n\nThe Vuforia camera stream inherits the issues present in the phone preview (namely ftc_app issue #574). This problem does not affect the TFOD camera stream even though it receives frames from Vuforia.\nThe orientation of the stream frames may not always match the phone preview. For now, these frames may be rotated manually via a custom CameraStreamSource if desired.\n\n\nOnBotJava\n\nBrowser back button may not always work correctly\nIt\'s possible for a build to be queued, but not started. The OnBot Java build console will display a warning if this occurs.\nA user might not realize they are editing a different file if the user inadvertently switches from one file to another since this switch is now seamless. The name of the currently open file is displayed in the browser tab.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.0 (built on 19.06.14)\n\nSupport for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\nAdds a Java preview pane to the Blocks editor.\nAdds a new offline export feature to the Blocks editor.\nDisplay wifi channel in Network circle on Driver Station.\nAdds calibration for Logitech C270\nUpdates build tooling and target SDK.\nCompliance with Google\'s permissions infrastructure (Required after build tooling update).\nKeep Alives to mitigate the Motorola wifi scanning problem.  Telemetry substitute no longer necessary.\nImproves Vuforia error reporting.\nFixes ftctechnh/ftc_app issues 621, 713.\nMiscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.3 (built on 18.10.31)\n\nIncludes missing TensorFlow-related libraries and files.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.2 (built on 18.10.30)\n\nIncludes fix to avoid deadlock situation with WatchdogMonitor which could result in USB communication errors.\n\nComm error appeared to require that user disconnect USB cable and restart the Robot Controller app to recover.\nrobotControllerLog.txt would have error messages that included the words ""E RobotCore: lynx xmit lock: #### abandoning lock:""\n\n\nIncludes fix to correctly list the parent module address for a REV Robotics Expansion Hub in a configuration (.xml) file.\n\nBug in versions 4.0 and 4.1 would incorrect list the address module for a parent REV Robotics device as ""1"".\nIf the parent module had a higher address value than the daisy-chained module, then this bug would prevent the Robot Controller from communicating with the downstream Expansion Hub.\n\n\nAdded requirement for ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION to allow a Driver Station running Android Oreo to scan for Wi-Fi Direct devices.\nAdded google() repo to build.gradle because aapt2 must be downloaded from the google() repository beginning with version 3.2 of the Android Gradle Plugin.\n\nImportant Note: Android Studio users will need to be connected to the Internet the first time build the ftc_app project.\nInternet connectivity is required for the first build so the appropriate files can be downloaded from the Google repository.\nUsers should not need to be connected to the Internet for subsequent builds.\nThis should also fix buid issue where Android Studio would complain that it ""Could not find com.android.tools.lint:lint-gradle:26.1.4"" (or similar).\n\n\nAdded support for REV Spark Mini motor controller as part of the configuration menu for a servo/PWM port on the REV Expansion Hub.\nProvide examples for playing audio files in an Op Mode.\nBlock Development Tool Changes\n\nIncludes a fix for a problem with the Velocity blocks that were reported in the FTC Technology forum (Blocks Programming subforum).\nChange the ""Save completed successfully."" message to a white color so it will contrast with a green background.\nFixed the ""Download image"" feature so it will work if there are text blocks in the op mode.\n\n\nIntroduce support for Google\'s TensorFlow Lite technology for object detetion for 2018-2019 game.\n\nTensorFlow lite can recognize Gold Mineral and Silver Mineral from 2018-2019 game.\nExample Java and Block op modes are included to show how to determine the relative position of the gold block (left, center, right).\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.1 (released on 18.09.24)\nChanges include:\n\nFix to prevent crash when deprecated configuration annotations are used.\nChange to allow FTC Robot Controller APK to be auto-updated using FIRST Global Control Hub update scripts.\nRemoved samples for non supported / non legal hardware.\nImprovements to Telemetry.addData block with ""text"" socket.\nUpdated Blocks sample op mode list to include Rover Ruckus Vuforia example.\nUpdate SDK library version number.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.0 (released on 18.09.12)\nChanges include:\n\n\nInitial support for UVC compatible cameras\n\nIf UVC camera has a unique serial number, RC will detect and enumerate by serial number.\nIf UVC camera lacks a unique serial number, RC will only support one camera of that type connected.\nCalibration settings for a few cameras are included (see TeamCode/src/main/res/xml/teamwebcamcalibrations.xml for details).\nUser can upload calibration files from Program and Manage web interface.\nUVC cameras seem to draw a fair amount of electrical current from the USB bus.\n\nThis does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n\n\n\n\nThis does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.\nFTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.\n\n\nUpdated sample Vuforia Navigation and VuMark Op Modes to demonstrate how to use an internal phone-based camera and an external UVC webcam.\n\n\n\nSupport for improved motor control.\n\nREV Robotics Expansion Hub firmware 1.8 and greater will support a feed forward mechanism for closed loop motor control.\nFTC SDK has been modified to support PIDF coefficients (proportional, integral, derivative, and feed forward).\nFTC Blocks development tool modified to include PIDF programming blocks.\nDeprecated older PID-related methods and variables.\nREV\'s 1.8.x PIDF-related changes provide a more linear and accurate way to control a motor.\n\n\n\nWireless\n\nAdded 5GHz support for wireless channel changing for those devices that support it.\n\nTested with Moto G5 and E4 phones.\n\n\n\n\nAlso tested with other (currently non-approved) phones such as Samsung Galaxy S8.\n\n\n\nImproved Expansion Hub firmware update support in Robot Controller app\n\nChanges to make the system more robust during the firmware update process (when performed through Robot Controller app).\nUser no longer has to disconnect a downstream daisy-chained Expansion Hub when updating an Expansion Hub\'s firmware.\n\nIf user is updating an Expansion Hub\'s firmware through a USB connection, he/she does not have to disconnect RS485 connection to other Expansion Hubs.\n\n\n\n\nThe user still must use a USB connection to update an Expansion Hub\'s firmware.\nThe user cannot update the Expansion Hub firmware for a downstream device that is daisy chained through an RS485 connection.\n\n\nIf an Expansion Hub accidentally gets ""bricked"" the Robot Controller app is now more likely to recognize the Hub when it scans the USB bus.\n\nRobot Controller app should be able to detect an Expansion Hub, even if it accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.\n\n\n\n\nRobot Controller app should be able to install the firmware onto the Hub, even if if accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.\n\n\n\nResiliency\n\nFTC software can detect and enable an FTDI reset feature that is available with REV Robotics v1.8 Expansion Hub firmware and greater.\n\nWhen enabled, the Expansion Hub can detect if it hasn\'t communicated with the Robot Controller over the FTDI (USB) connection.\n\n\n\n\nIf the Hub hasn\'t heard from the Robot Controller in a while, it will reset the FTDI connection.\nThis action helps system recover from some ESD-induced disruptions.\n\n\nVarious fixes to improve reliability of FTC software.\n\n\n\nBlocks\n\nFixed errors with string and list indices in blocks export to java.\nSupport for USB connected UVC webcams.\nRefactored optimized Blocks Vuforia code to support Rover Ruckus image targets.\nAdded programming blocks to support PIDF (proportional, integral, derivative and feed forward) motor control.\nAdded formatting options (under Telemetry and Miscellaneous categories) so user can set how many decimal places to display a numerical value.\nSupport to play audio files (which are uploaded through Blocks web interface) on Driver Station in addition to the Robot Controller.\nFixed bug with Download Image of Blocks feature.\nSupport for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\nSupport for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor.\nAdded support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device).\nAdded blocks for DcMotorEx methods.\n\nThese are enhanced methods that you can use when supported by the motor controller hardware.\n\n\n\n\nThe REV Robotics Expansion Hub supports these enhanced methods.\nEnhanced methods include methods to get/set motor velocity (in encoder pulses per second), get/set PIDF coefficients, etc..\n\n\n\nModest Improvements in Logging\n\nDecrease frequency of battery checker voltage statements.\nRemoved non-FTC related log statements (wherever possible).\nIntroduced a ""Match Logging"" feature.\n\nUnder ""Settings"" a user can enable/disable this feature (it\'s disabled by default).\n\n\n\n\nIf enabled, user provides a ""Match Number"" through the Driver Station user interface (top of the screen).\n\nThe Match Number is used to create a log file specifically with log statements from that particular Op Mode run.\nMatch log files are stored in /sdcard/FIRST/matlogs on the Robot Controller.\nOnce an op mode run is complete, the Match Number is cleared.\nThis is a convenient way to create a separate match log with statements only related to a specific op mode run.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Devices\n\nSupport for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\nSupport for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor.\nAdded configuration option for REV 20:1 HD Hex Motor.\nAdded support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device).\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFixed some errors in the definitions for acceleration and velocity in our javadoc documentation.\nAdded ability to play audio files on Driver Station\nWhen user is configuring an Expansion Hub, the LED on the Expansion Hub will change blink pattern (purple-cyan)  to indicate which Hub is currently being configured.\nRenamed I2cSensorType to I2cDeviceType.\nAdded an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates localization using 2018-2019 (Rover Ruckus presented by QualComm) Vuforia targets.\nAdded an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics 2m Laser Distance Sensor.\nAdded an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\nRe-categorized external Java sample Op Modes to ""TeleOp"" instead of ""Autonomous"".\n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\n\nInitial support for UVC compatible cameras\n\nUVC cameras seem to draw significant amount of current from the USB bus.\n\nThis does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n\n\n\n\nThis does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.\nFTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.\n\n\nThere might be a possible deadlock which causes the RC to become unresponsive when using a UVC webcam with a Nougat Android Robot Controller.\n\n\n\nWireless\n\nWhen user selects a wireless channel, this channel does not necessarily persist if the phone is power cycled.\n\nTech Team is hoping to eventually address this issue in a future release.\n\n\n\n\nIssue has been present since apps were introduced (i.e., it is not new with the v4.0 release).\n\n\nWireless channel is not currently displayed for WiFi Direct connections.\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe blink indication feature that shows which Expansion Hub is currently being configured does not work for a newly created configuration file.\n\nUser has to first save a newly created configuration file and then close and re-edit the file in order for blink indicator to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 3.6 (built on 17.12.18)\nChanges include:\n\nBlocks Changes\n\nUses updated Google Blockly software to allow users to edit their op modes on Apple iOS devices (including iPad and iPhone).\nImprovement in Blocks tool to handle corrupt op mode files.\nAutonomous op modes should no longer get switched back to tele-op after re-opening them to be edited.\nThe system can now detect type mismatches during runtime and alert the user with a message on the Driver Station.\n\n\nUpdated javadoc documentation for setPower() method to reflect correct range of values (-1 to +1).\nModified VuforiaLocalizerImpl to allow for user rendering of frames\n\nAdded a user-overrideable onRenderFrame() method which gets called by the class\'s renderFrame() method.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 3.5 (built on 17.10.30)\nChanges with version 3.5 include:\n\nIntroduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which can occur after the Robot Controller app has been paused and then resumed (for example, when a user temporarily turns off the display of the Robot Controller phone, and then turns the screen back on).\nIntroduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which were previously caused by random peer disconnect events on the Driver Station.\nFixes issue where log files would be closed on pause of the RC or DS, but not re-opened upon resume.\nFixes issue with battery handler (voltage) start/stop race.\nFixes issue where Android Studio generated op modes would disappear from available list in certain situations.\nFixes problem where OnBot Java would not build on REV Robotics Control Hub.\nFixes problem where OnBot Java would not build if the date and time on the Robot Controller device was ""rewound"" (set to an earlier date/time).\nImproved error message on OnBot Java that occurs when renaming a file fails.\nRemoved unneeded resources from android.jar binaries used by OnBot Java to reduce final size of Robot Controller app.\nAdded MR_ANALOG_TOUCH_SENSOR block to Blocks Programming Tool.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 3.4 (built on 17.09.06)\nChanges with version 3.4 include:\n\nAdded telemetry.update() statement for BlankLinearOpMode template.\nRenamed sample Block op modes to be more consistent with Java samples.\nAdded some additional sample Block op modes.\nReworded OnBot Java readme slightly.\n\n\nVersion 3.3 (built on 17.09.04)\nThis version of the software includes improves for the FTC Blocks Programming Tool and the OnBot Java Programming Tool.\nChanges with verion 3.3 include:\n\nAndroid Studio ftc_app project has been updated to use Gradle Plugin 2.3.3.\nAndroid Studio ftc_app project is already using gradle 3.5 distribution.\nRobot Controller log has been renamed to /sdcard/RobotControllerLog.txt (note that this change was actually introduced w/ v3.2).\nImprovements in I2C reliability.\nOptimized I2C read for REV Expansion Hub, with v1.7 firmware or greater.\nUpdated all external/samples (available through OnBot and in Android project folder).\nVuforia\n\nAdded support for VuMarks that will be used for the 2017-2018 season game.\n\n\nBlocks\n\nUpdate to latest Google Blockly release.\nSample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode.\nFixed bug where the blocks would disappear temporarily when mouse button is held down.\nAdded blocks for Range.clip and Range.scale.\nUser can now disable/enable Block op modes.\nFix to prevent occasional Blocks deadlock.\n\n\nOnBot Java\n\nSignificant improvements with autocomplete function for OnBot Java editor.\nSample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode.\nFixes and changes to complete hardware setup feature.\nUpdated (and more useful) onBot welcome message.\n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nAndroid Studio\n\nAfter updating to the new v3.3 Android Studio project folder, if you get error messages indicating ""InvalidVirtualFileAccessException"" then you might need to do a File->Invalidate Caches / Restart to clear the error.\n\n\nOnBot Java\n\nSometimes when you push the build button to build all op modes, the RC returns an error message that the build failed.  If you press the build button a second time, the build typically suceeds.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 3.2 (built on 17.08.02)\nThis version of the software introduces the ""OnBot Java"" Development Tool.  Similar to the FTC Blocks Development Tool, the FTC OnBot Java Development Tool allows a user to create, edit and build op modes dynamically using only a Javascript-enabled web browser.\nThe OnBot Java Development Tool is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is served up by the Robot Controller.  Op modes are created and edited using a Javascript-enabled browser (Google Chromse is recommended).  Op modes are saved on the Robot Controller Android device directly.\nThe OnBot Java Development Tool provides a Java programming environment that does NOT need Android Studio.\nChanges with version 3.2 include:\n\n\nEnhanced web-based development tools\n\nIntroduction of OnBot Java Development Tool.\nWeb-based programming and management features are ""always on"" (user no longer needs to put Robot Controller into programming mode).\nWeb-based management interface (where user can change Robot Controller name and also easily download Robot Controller log file).\nOnBot Java, Blocks and Management features available from web based interface.\n\n\n\nBlocks Programming Development Tool:\n\nChanged ""LynxI2cColorRangeSensor"" block to ""REV Color/range sensor"" block.\nFixed tooltip for ColorSensor.isLightOn block.\nAdded blocks for ColorSensor.getNormalizedColors and LynxI2cColorRangeSensor.getNormalizedColors.\n\n\n\nAdded example op modes for digital touch sensor and REV Robotics Color Distance sensor.\n\n\nUser selectable color themes.\n\n\nIncludes many minor enhancements and fixes (too numerous to list).\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nAuto complete function is incomplete and does not support the following (for now):\n\nAccess via this keyword\nAccess via super keyword\nMembers of the super cloass, not overridden by the class\nAny methods provided in the current class\nInner classes\nCan\'t handle casted objects\nAny objects coming from an parenthetically enclosed expression\n\n\n\n\nVersion 3.10 (built on 17.05.09)\nThis version of the software provides support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub.  This version also includes improvements in the USB communication layer in an effort to enhance system resiliency.  If you were using a 2.x version of the software previously, updating to version 3.1 requires that you also update your Driver Station software in addition to updating the Robot Controller software.\nAlso note that in version 3.10 software, the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods are no longer available (not deprecated, they have been removed from the SDK). Also note that the the new 3.x software incorporates motor profiles that a user can select as he/she configures the robot.\nChanges include:\n\nBlocks changes\n\nAdded VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener.getPose and Vuforia.trackPose blocks.\nAdded optimized blocks support for Vuforia extended tracking.\nAdded atan2 block to the math category.\nAdded useCompetitionFieldTargetLocations parameter to Vuforia.initialize block.  If set to false, the target locations are placed at (0,0,0) with target orientation as specified in https://github.com/gearsincorg/FTCVuforiaDemo/blob/master/Robot_Navigation.java tutorial op mode.\n\n\nIncorporates additional improvements to USB comm layer to improve system resiliency (to recover from a greater number of communication disruptions).\n\n\nAdditional Notes Regarding Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)\nIn addition to the release changes listed below (see section labeled ""Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.013)""), version 3.00 has the following important changes:\n\nVersion 3.00 software uses a new version of the FTC Robocol (robot protocol).  If you upgrade to v3.0 on the Robot Controller and/or Android Studio side, you must also upgrade the Driver Station software to match the new Robocol.\nVersion 3.00 software removes the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods from the DcMotor class.  If you have an op mode that formerly used these methods, you will need to remove the references/calls to these methods.  Instead, v3.0 provides the max speed information through the use of motor profiles that are selected by the user during robot configuration.\nVersion 3.00 software currently does not have a mechanism to disable extra i2c sensors.  We hope to re-introduce this function with a release in the near future.\n\n\nVersion 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)\n*** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***\nThis software is being released as an ""alpha"" version.  Use this version at your own risk!\nThis pre-release software contains SIGNIFICANT changes, including changes to the Wi-Fi Direct pairing mechanism, rewrites of the I2C sensor classes, changes to the USB/FTDI layer, and the introduction of support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub and the REV Robotics color-range-light sensor.  These changes were implemented to improve the reliability and resiliency of the FTC control system.\nPlease note, however, that version 3.00 is considered ""alpha"" code.  This code is being released so that the FIRST community will have an opportunity to test the new REV Expansion Hub electronics module when it becomes available in May.  The developers do not recommend using this code for critical applications (i.e., competition use).\n*** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***\nChanges include:\n\nMajor rework of sensor-related infrastructure.

This is important - we no longer set the motor modes through the motor controller.\nsetMode and getMode were added to the DcMotor class.\nContinuousRotationServo class has been added to the FTC SDK.\nRange.clip() method has been overloaded so it can support this operation for int, short and byte integers.\nSome changes have been made (new methods added) on how a user can access items from the hardware map.\nUsers can now set the zero power behavior for a DC motor so that the motor will brake or float when power is zero.\nPrototype Blockly Programming Mode has been added to FTC Robot Controller.  Users can place the Robot Controller into this mode, and then use a device (such as a laptop) that has a Javascript enabled browser to write Blockly-based Op Modes directly onto the Robot Controller.\nUsers can now configure the robot remotely through the FTC Driver Station app.\nAndroid Studio project supports Android Studio 2.1.x and compile SDK Version 23 (Marshmallow).\nVuforia Computer Vision SDK integrated into FTC SDK.  Users can use sample vision targets to get localization information on a standard FTC field.\nProject structure has been reorganized so that there is now a TeamCode package that users can use to place their local/custom Op Modes into this package.\nInspection function has been integrated into the FTC Robot Controller and Driver Station Apps (Thanks Team HazMat… 9277 & 10650!).\nAudio cues have been incorporated into FTC SDK.\nSwap mechanism added to FTC Robot Controller configuration activity.  For example, if you have two motor controllers on a robot, and you misidentified them in your configuration file, you can use the Swap button to swap the devices within the configuration file (so you do not have to manually re-enter in the configuration info for the two devices).\nFix mechanism added to all user to replace an electronic module easily.  For example, suppose a servo controller dies on your robot. You replace the broken module with a new module, which has a different serial number from the original servo controller.  You can use the Fix button to automatically reconfigure your configuration file to use the serial number of the new module.\nImprovements made to fix resiliency and responsiveness of the system.\nFor LinearOpMode the user now must for a telemetry.update() to update the telemetry data on the driver station.  This update() mechanism ensures that the driver station gets the updated data properly and at the same time.\nThe Auto Configure function of the Robot Controller is now template based.  If there is a commonly used robot configuration, a template can be created so that the Auto Configure mechanism can be used to quickly configure a robot of this type.\nThe logic to detect a runaway op mode (both in the LinearOpMode and OpMode types) and to abort the run, then auto recover has been improved/implemented.\nFix has been incorporated so that Logitech F310 gamepad mappings will be correct for Marshmallow users.\n\n\nRelease 16.07.08\n\nFor the ftc_app project, the gradle files have been modified to support Android Studio 2.1.x.\n\n\nRelease 16.03.30\n\nFor the MIT App Inventor, the design blocks have new icons that better represent the function of each design component.\nSome changes were made to the shutdown logic to ensure the robust shutdown of some of our USB services.\nA change was made to LinearOpMode so as to allow a given instance to be executed more than once, which is required for the App Inventor.\nJavadoc improved/updated.\n\n\nRelease 16.03.09\n\nChanges made to make the FTC SDK synchronous (significant change!)\n\nwaitOneFullHardwareCycle() and waitForNextHardwareCycle() are no longer needed and have been deprecated.\nrunOpMode() (for a LinearOpMode) is now decoupled from the system\'s hardware read/write thread.\nloop() (for an OpMode) is now decoupled from the system\'s hardware read/write thread.\nMethods are synchronous.\nFor example, if you call setMode(DcMotorController.RunMode.RESET_ENCODERS) for a motor, the encoder is guaranteed to be reset when the method call is complete.\nFor legacy module (NXT compatible), user no longer has to toggle between read and write modes when reading from or writing to a legacy device.\n\n\nChanges made to enhance reliability/robustness during ESD event.\nChanges made to make code thread safe.\nDebug keystore added so that user-generated robot controller APKs will all use the same signed key (to avoid conflicts if a team has multiple developer laptops for example).\nFirmware version information for Modern Robotics modules are now logged.\nChanges made to improve USB comm reliability and robustness.\nAdded support for voltage indicator for legacy (NXT-compatible) motor controllers.\nChanges made to provide auto stop capabilities for op modes.\n\nA LinearOpMode class will stop when the statements in runOpMode() are complete.  User does not have to push the stop button on the driver station.\nIf an op mode is stopped by the driver station, but there is a run away/uninterruptible thread persisting, the app will log an error message then force itself to crash to stop the runaway thread.\n\n\nDriver Station UI modified to display lowest measured voltage below current voltage (12V battery).\nDriver Station UI modified to have color background for current voltage (green=good, yellow=caution, red=danger, extremely low voltage).\njavadoc improved (edits and additional classes).\nAdded app build time to About activity for driver station and robot controller apps.\nDisplay local IP addresses on Driver Station About activity.\nAdded I2cDeviceSynchImpl.\nAdded I2cDeviceSync interface.\nAdded seconds() and milliseconds() to ElapsedTime for clarity.\nAdded getCallbackCount() to I2cDevice.\nAdded missing clearI2cPortActionFlag.\nAdded code to create log messages while waiting for LinearOpMode shutdown.\nFix so Wifi Direct Config activity will no longer launch multiple times.\nAdded the ability to specify an alternate i2c address in software for the Modern Robotics gyro.\n\n\nRelease 16.02.09\n\nImproved battery checker feature so that voltage values get refreshed regularly (every 250 msec) on Driver Station (DS) user interface.\nImproved software so that Robot Controller (RC) is much more resilient and “self-healing” to USB disconnects:\n\nIf user attempts to start/restart RC with one or more module missing, it will display a warning but still start up.\nWhen running an op mode, if one or more modules gets disconnected, the RC & DS will display warnings,and robot will keep on working in spite of the missing module(s).\nIf a disconnected module gets physically reconnected the RC will auto detect the module and the user will regain control of the recently connected module.\nWarning messages are more helpful (identifies the type of module that’s missing plus its USB serial number).\n\n\nCode changes to fix the null gamepad reference when users try to reference the gamepads in the init() portion of their op mode.\nNXT light sensor output is now properly scaled.  Note that teams might have to readjust their light threshold values in their op modes.\nOn DS user interface, gamepad icon for a driver will disappear if the matching gamepad is disconnected or if that gamepad gets designated as a different driver.\nRobot Protocol (ROBOCOL) version number info is displayed in About screen on RC and DS apps.\nIncorporated a display filter on pairing screen to filter out devices that don’t use the “-“ format. This filter can be turned off to show all WiFi Direct devices.\nUpdated text in License file.\nFixed formatting error in OpticalDistanceSensor.toString().\nFixed issue on with a blank (“”) device name that would disrupt WiFi Direct Pairing.\nMade a change so that the WiFi info and battery info can be displayed more quickly on the DS upon connecting to RC.\nImproved javadoc generation.\nModified code to make it easier to support language localization in the future.\n\n\nRelease 16.01.04\n\nUpdated compileSdkVersion for apps\nPrevent Wifi from entering power saving mode\nremoved unused import from driver station\nCorrrected ""Dead zone"" joystick code.\nLED.getDeviceName and .getConnectionInfo() return null\napps check for ROBOCOL_VERSION mismatch\nFix for Telemetry also has off-by-one errors in its data string sizing / short size limitations error\nUser telemetry output is sorted.\nadded formatting variants to DbgLog and RobotLog APIs\ncode modified to allow for a long list of op mode names.\nchanges to improve thread safety of RobocolDatagramSocket\nFix for ""missing hardware leaves robot controller disconnected from driver station"" error\nfix for ""fast tapping of Init/Start causes problems"" (toast is now only instantiated on UI thread).\nadded some log statements for thread life cycle.\nmoved gamepad reset logic inside of initActiveOpMode() for robustness\nchanges made to mitigate risk of race conditions on public methods.\nchanges to try and flag when WiFi Direct name contains non-printable characters.\nfix to correct race condition between .run() and .close() in ReadWriteRunnableStandard.\nupdated FTDI driver\nmade ReadWriteRunnableStanard interface public.\nfixed off-by-one errors in Command constructor\nmoved specific hardware implmentations into their own package.\nmoved specific gamepad implemnatations to the hardware library.\nchanged LICENSE file to new BSD version.\nfixed race condition when shutting down Modern Robotics USB devices.\nmethods in the ColorSensor classes have been synchronized.\ncorrected isBusy() status to reflect end of motion.\ncorrected ""back"" button keycode.\nthe notSupported() method of the GyroSensor class was changed to protected (it should not be public).\n\n\nRelease 15.11.04.001\n\nAdded Support for Modern Robotics Gyro.\n\n\nThe GyroSensor class now supports the MR Gyro Sensor.\nUsers can access heading data (about Z axis)\nUsers can also access raw gyro data (X, Y, & Z axes).\nExample MRGyroTest.java op mode included.\n\n\nImproved error messages\n\n\nMore descriptive error messages for exceptions in user code.\n\n\nUpdated DcMotor API\nEnable read mode on new address in setI2cAddress\nFix so that driver station app resets the gamepads when switching op modes.\nUSB-related code changes to make USB comm more responsive and to display more explicit error messages.\n\n\nFix so that USB will recover properly if the USB bus returns garbage data.\nFix USB initializtion race condition.\nBetter error reporting during FTDI open.\nMore explicit messages during USB failures.\nFixed bug so that USB device is closed if event loop teardown method was not called.\n\n\nFixed timer UI issue\nFixed duplicate name UI bug (Legacy Module configuration).\nFixed race condition in EventLoopManager.\nFix to keep references stable when updating gamepad.\nFor legacy Matrix motor/servo controllers removed necessity of appending ""Motor"" and ""Servo"" to controller names.\nUpdated HT color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbLegacyModule class.\nUpdated MR color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbDeviceInterfaceModule class.\nCorrectly handle I2C Address change in all color sensors\nUpdated/cleaned up op modes.\n\n\nUpdated comments in LinearI2cAddressChange.java example op mode.\nReplaced the calls to ""setChannelMode"" with ""setMode"" (to match the new of the DcMotor  method).\nRemoved K9AutoTime.java op mode.\nAdded MRGyroTest.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Gyro Sensor).\nAdded MRRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Color Sensor).\nAdded HTRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use HT legacy color sensor).\nAdded MatrixControllerDemo.java (demonstrates how to use legacy Matrix controller).\n\n\nUpdated javadoc documentation.\nUpdated release .apk files for Robot Controller and Driver Station apps.\n\nT.

The LiDAR was conceived on the main robot file, but it had to be ""isolated"" in a Part Studio of it\'s own because it has mobility - the top part should be able to rotate around the vertical axis (usually the z-axis). The same idea applies to the wheels and the sphere or anything that will rotate around an axis, because when describing them in the .xacro file, the axis of rotation will be generated at the origin seen on Onshape.\nTo make possible interaction with ROS, a .xacro file was derived from the original .sdf file. They are both XML files, and their structure is very similar, although some parameters will be described in with a different syntax or will have different names (""pose"" may become ""origin"", and stuff like that)\nThe .xacro file describes not only the physical structure of the robot, but it also involves the LiDAR ray parameters, and the Velodyne plugin associated. This plugin is based on Gazebo plugin ""gazebo_ros_block_laser"".\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/azihell', 'info_list': ['JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 16, 2020', 'PHP', 'Updated Jan 18, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 18, 2020', '2', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 19, 2020', '2', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 9, 2021', 'C++', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 17, 2020', '1', 'Java', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 14, 2021', 'Updated Jan 17, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Dec 18, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 17, 2020']}"
