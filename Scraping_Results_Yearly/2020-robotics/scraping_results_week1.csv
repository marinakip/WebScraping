Just keep in mind that deploying does not run any automated tests.\nSimulation\n./gradlew sim4788, or ./gradlew simTestBot\nSimulation will boot up a simulation of the robot code running on your own computer. This is used to see code running without a working robot, and includes a few simulation hooks for things like a tank drive and motor outputs.\nNOTE: If you're running on Linux or MacOS, you should run killall frcUserProgram between calls to this. On windows, just ensure the command window that pops up is closed between runs. You can only have one simulator running at once!\nRunning Vision\n./gradlew runVision\nYou can run vision on your local computer without needing a Raspberry Pi or Tinker Board to test on. As long as you have an external webcam, you should be A OK.\nProjects\n4788\nThis is the team code. The code in these projects should be very minimal, since most will be put into common. This code should only initialize the layout / configuration of the robot and hand off most control to commonRobot. This allows us to share code between the two teams.\n4788 both depend on wml.\nWML\nWML is the library for robot code on the RoboRio, designed to simplify FRC programming, and give usefull functions to use.

A meta-operating system can be understood as an abstraction layer over an existing operating system and in that it provides us with a framework to test and design our robot.\nIt has a range of supported programming languages namely, C++ and Python and is a popular among the open source community. As such, there are a wide range of packages and codes that are available to us to choose from as well as extensive documentation on its operation. Utilising the freely available in-built and additional packages, ROS can give finer control of the robot without writing all control methods from scratch.\nOverview\nThe purpose of this project is to familiarize with ROS. Using unique packages pre-built by developers of ROS, we perform multiple actions of movement, localization, map building and then autonomous navigation. We will break down the process and discuss them in details further below.\nObjectives\nThe objectives in this project are enumerated below:\n1. Initialization and Navigation of a robot, Turtlebot 2 in this case\nFor initialization and navigation of the robot, we used turtlebot_vibot package compiled by the Robotics Lab, France team at Condorcet (https://github.com/roboticslab-fr), University of Burgundy.\n2. Construction of a local map of the environment of the robot\nUsing the same package we build the map of the robotics lab of Condorcet.\n3. Movement of robot in the newly built map\nThis step uses \'Rviz\' to move the robot in the custom built map, this time within the confined boundaries without manual control.\n4. Defining the position points in the map for autonomous navigation\nSince the newly built map is a planar map, landmark position points in the map can be denoted by 2D vector.\n5. Using packages for reading QR code at the position points\nWe used Python libraries for reading the QR codes at landmark points using the Kinect RGB camera.\n6. Play sound once QR code is detected\nFor playing the sound upon successful registering of the QR code using another package called sound-publisher.\n7. Creating own launch files to unify all the functions\nWriting script for one launch file in order to launch all necessary scripts at once instead of calling them once at a time.\nMethodology\nLet\'s break down certain important concepts of ROS and how it works.\n\n\nNODE : A node can be understood as a task, just like processes in an operating system. A node is a program to execute certain functions. By subscribing to a \'topic\' and processing the information, a node then publishes the processed information to another \'topic\'.\n\n\nTOPIC : A topic is a processed information index which has certain messages inside post- or pre-processing of information from a node. One can check existing topics by using command rostopic.\n\n\nMESSAGES : The information inside the various topics. Each topic, depending on the type of topic, has different information and may continuously publish information to the system.\n\n\nMASTER : It us the \'master\' node. A system has unique master nodes for different devices. If an electronic system is interacting with different components which were not designed to work together natively, those components will have different master nodes which will publish processed information over a topic which can be subscribed by another master node.\n\n\nROSLAUNCH : It is the command to launch ROS commands which will in turn start the different nodes.\n\n\nRQT_GRAPH : A visual representation of the nodes and topics of the system with connections showing where the nodes originate and which topics are being published and subscribed by which systems.\n\n\nROSOUT : Console log reporting system in ROS.\n\n\nThe packages we have used in our project are:\n\n\nturtlebot_vibot -\nContains nodes which can initialize and operate the Kobuki base of the Turtlebot, the Kinect and the LIDAR connected to a computer. The package also has nodes for controlling the Kobuki base for navigation and publishing the odometry data with relevant topics in the subpackage turtlebot_vibot_nav. This subpackage also contains amcl (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization) node to build a map with localization data which is fetched from LIDAR and Kinect.\n\n\nrbx1 -\nROS By Example or rbx, contains multiple nodes which make use of various control nodes on both the master and the client terminal. We exclusively make use of a Python script in the subpackage cv_bridge_demo.py in \'rbx1_vision\' which we have modified to add our script to detect the QR code from Kinect\'s camera using OpenCV libraries.\n\n\nrplidar_ros -\nA LIDAR package from Slamtec, installation and configuration of it is required for the operation of the LIDAR.\n\n\ncv_bridge -\nConverts between ROS Image messages and OpenCV images. As the QR code reader program is based on the OpenCV platform, the bridge is required to translate between ROS and the OpenCV program.\n\n\nturtlebot_rviz_launchers -\nThe master and client are assigned their own WiFi modules, connected over a local network and a given static IPs. Usually, the client cannot be connected to two network adaptors at the same time. Once the client and the master have been turned on and connected over the local network, we run the custom launch file which in turn calls for execution of other launch files from the turtlebot_vibot.\n\n\nDownload the MSCV5 launch files by navigating to your catkin_ws/src folder and in the terminal, type:\n$ git clone https://github.com/synthaseatp/grp_5_master.git\n$ git clone https://github.com/synthaseatp/sound_package.git\n\nThe first launch file calls for the following nodes:\n\nroslaunch grp_5 grp_5_master.launch\n\nThe following are the contents of the launch file on the master:\n<launch>\n  <include file=""$(find turtlebot_rviz_launchers)/launch/view_navigation.launch"" />\n  <include file=""$(find rbx1_vision)/launch/qr_read.launch"" />\n  <node pkg=""grp_5"" name=""move4test"" type=""nodes/test_joker.py"" output=""screen"" /\n</launch>\n\nThe following are the contents of the launch file on the master:\n<launch>\n  <include file=""$(find turtlebot_vibot_bringup)/launch/minimal_rplidar.launch"" />\n  <include file=""$(find turtlebot_vibot_bringup)/launch/3dsensor_rplidar.launch"" />\n  <include file=""$(find turtlebot_vibot_nav)/launch/amcl_demo_rplidar.launch"" >\n    <arg name=""map_file"" value=""$(find turtlebot_vibot_nav)/maps/Soon_map_15Nov.yaml"" />\n  </include>\n</launch>\n\nThe launch file executes the following launch files on the client:\n\nturtlebot_vibot_bringup 3dsensor_rplidar.launch\nturtlebot_vibot_nav amcl_demo_rplidar.launch\n\nAnd on the master:\n\nturtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch\n\nMapping\nThe mapping was conducted with the reference guide provided from the professors: turtlebot_vibot.\nUtilising LIDAR, and manual control of the Turtlebot through the use of the joystick, we bring the turtlebot around the lab in order to map out the lab.\nWe first perform the minimum launch on the Turtlebot\n$ roslaunch turtlebot_vibot_bringup minimal_rplidar.launch\n\nfollowed by initialising the modofied gmapping demo file\n$ roslaunch turtlebot_vibot_nav gmapping_demo_rplidar.launch\n\nNext we need to initialise the joystick teleop for the logitech controller on the Workstation\n$ roslaunch turtlebot_teleop logitech.launch --screen\n\nAs well as the Rviz on the workstation for visualization\n$ roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch\n\nAfter moving carefully behind the turtlebot, we are able to obtain the following map:\n\nWhich is saved with the following command\n$ roscd turtlebot_vibot_nav/maps/\n\n$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f my_map\n\nLocalization and Navigation via the RVIZ\nBefore we can proceed with the navigation of the turtlebot, we need to first localize the map and then run the robot in the RVIZ manually to obtain the point coordinates and quartenion of the map.\nWe first define the turtlebot mapfile variable and launch the AMCL demo file together using the following command\n$ roslaunch turtlebot_vibot_nav amcl_demo_rplidar.launch map_file:=`rospack find turtlebot_vibot_nav`/maps/Soon_map_15Nov.yaml\n\nWhile we could also export the turtlebot mapfile variable using the following command,\n$ export TURTLEBOT_MAP_FILE=/...path.../map.yaml\n\nWe noticed that sometimes the command will result in a corrupted map, causing failure during the navigation process.\nWe then run the RVIZ on the workstation\n$ roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch --screen\n\nIn order to start the navigation process of the turtlebot through the RVIZ, we have to select the ""2D point pose estimate"" button to help the turtlebot discover its initial position. Finally, we can move the turtlebot around the map using the ""2D Nav Goal"" button.\nBy moving the robot across the map and marking its initialisation position, we are able to obtain the quartenion information of the robot. This will allow us to specify the waypoints of the robot for later use during our autonomous navigation of the turtlebot.\n\nWe then select 4 waypoints on the map to be used during the autonomous navigation process of the turtlebot.\n\n\nHome - Where we start the turtlebot and the place where the turtlebot returns\nGreek - The first waypoint, named in respect of the Greek team in our class.\nFront - The second way point, which is in front of the lab\nFrance - The third waypoint, named in respect of the French team in our class.\nRear - The fourth way point, which is at the back of the lab\n\nLocalization, Autonomous Navigation, and Task Activation\nThe core of the program is based on the ROS by Example code that is given to us in the ROS By Example, Volume 1, that can be obtained via this link:\nhttps://github.com/pirobot/rbx1/blob/indigo-devel/rbx1_nav/nodes/nav_test.py\nThe program has been modified in order to suit and parts of the program is explained as follows:\nclass NavTest():\n  def __init__(self):\n    rospy.on_shutdown(self.shutdown)\n\n    # How long in seconds should the robot pause at each location?\n    self.rest_time = rospy.get_param(""~rest_time"", 10)\n\n\nWe set the time for how long the robot will stop at each location. The reason why this is important is to give enough time for the robot to read the code and play the song.\nlocations = dict()\n  locations[\'Greek\'] = Pose(Point(1.767, -0.075, 0.000), Quaternion(0.000, 0.000, 0.694, 0.720))\n  locations[\'Front\'] = Pose(Point(4.991, -2.083, 0.000), Quaternion(0.000, 0.000, -0.003, 1.000))\n  locations[\'France\'] = Pose(Point(1.973, -3.711, 0.000), Quaternion(0.000, 0.000, -0.708, 0.706))\n  locations[\'Rear\'] = Pose(Point(-1.036,-1.389, 0.000), Quaternion(0.000, 0.000, 1.000,0.013 ))\n  locations[\'Home\'] = Pose(Point(-0.038, 0.039, 0.000), Quaternion(0.000, 0.000, 0.690, 0.724))\n\nThe waypoints are then built into a dictionary, specifying the coordinates as well as the Quaternion pose of the robot.\n# Subscribe to the move_base action server\nself.move_base = actionlib.SimpleActionClient(""move_base"", MoveBaseAction)\nself.bridgeDemo = qr_read.cvBridgeDemo()\n\nrospy.loginfo(""Waiting for move_base action server..."")\n\nWe then subscribe to the move base action server along with the QR code reader information.\n# Begin the main loop and run through a sequence of locations\nwhile not rospy.is_shutdown():\n    # If we\'ve gone through the current sequence,\n    # start with a new random sequence\n  if i == n_locations:\n      i = 0\n      sequence = [""Greek"", ""Front"", ""France"", ""Rear"", ""Home""]\n      # Skip over first location if it is the same as\n      # the last location\n      if sequence[0] == last_location:\n          i = 1\n\n  # Get the next location in the current sequence\n  location = sequence[i]\n\nHere we define the sequence in which the Turtlebot will move from one point to another. The turtle bot is set up so that it will move from the Home>Greek>Front>France>Rear before finally returning to its home position. After which it will repeat the whole process again.\nif not finished_within_time:\n  self.move_base.cancel_goal()\n  rospy.loginfo(""Timed out achieving goal"")\nelse:\n  state = self.move_base.get_state()\n  if state == GoalStatus.SUCCEEDED:\n      rospy.loginfo(""Goal succeeded!"")\n      n_successes += 1\n      distance_traveled += distance\n      rospy.loginfo(""State:"" + str(state))\n      self.bridgeDemo.talk()\n  else:\n    rospy.loginfo(""Goal failed with error code: "" + str(goal_states[state]))\n\nHere we begin the reading process each time the robot has successfully reached its position. When the turtlebot sucessfully reaches a targetted waypoint, it will call out to the QR reader module, read the code that is displayed by the QR code, which will then be displayed in the form of a string. This in turn will then activate the song player to play a song according to the code that it has read.\nIf the robot has failed to reach its goal for whatever reason, it will print out an error message.\nThe turtlebot will continue to go around the waypoints, until the program is terminated.\nHere\'s the view of start of the navigation:\n\nWhere you can see that we accessing depth map, RGB image and a processed image showing edges in invidual windows. In the background is the RVIZ simulator which shows the current map of the lab.\nQR Detection and Sound Play\nusing Pyzbar\nZbar is an old method but appears to be one of the best method in order to detect and read Qr codes. The main idea behind the detection is to go through an image researching typical point, rectangle and symbol, which are used inside the Qr code. First of all, the image is read with a scanner function, then it starts to search the symbol and then decodes it. For more information about the libraries, check the source code on Github [10]. Thanks to a decode function using this library, we are able to obtain several information about our Qr code, such as:\n\nQr code type (barcode,Qrcode);\nData coded inside the Qr or bar code;\nA rectangle which is actually surrounding the Qr;\nA polygon that contain the main point of the Qr code.\n\ndef decode(self, im) :\n  # Find barcodes and QR codes\n  decodedObjects = pyzbar.decode(im)\n  return decodedObjects\n\ndef qr_code_processor(self, frame):\n  #Read image and first init in the loop\n  im = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n  self.decodedObjects = self.decode(im)\n\n  for decodedObject in self.decodedObjects:\n    points = decodedObject.polygon\n\n    self.nts = decodedObject.data.decode(""utf-8"")\n\n    # If the points do not form a quad, find convex hull\n    if len(points) > 4 :\n      hull = cv2.convexHull(np.array([point for point in points], dtype=np.float32))\n      hull = list(map(tuple, np.squeeze(hull)))\n    else :\n      hull = points;\n    # Number of points in the convex hull\n    n = len(hull)\n\n    # Draw the convext hull\n    for j in range(0,n):\n      cv2.line(frame, hull[j], hull[ (j+1) % n], (255,0,0), 3)\n\n    x = decodedObject.rect.left\n    y = decodedObject.rect.top\n\n    if self.last_data is None or self.last_data != decodedObject.data:\n      self.last_data = decodedObject.data\n      print(x, y)\n      print(\'Type : \', decodedObject.type)\n      print(\'Data : \', decodedObject.data,\'\\n\')\n\n    barCode = str(decodedObject.data)\n    cv2.putText(frame, barCode, (x, y), font, 1, (0,255,255), 2, cv2.LINE_AA)\n\n  # Display the resulting frame\n  # cv2.imshow(\'frame\',frame)\n  return frame\n\nThanks to this different information we will be able to do several interesting works with our Qr code. The first interesting part is we are now able to recognize different types of codes, such as bar codes and Qr codes. We are also able to track the Qr code thanks to the information relative to the position of the decoded object (polygon and point). With this geometrical information it becomes quite easy to create a bounding box around the Qr code and to track it. Thanks to the coordinate of the rectangle, we are able to place a label on the top of our Qr code whatever its position. Then, we are also able to read whatever is coded inside the Qr code. That opens a new dimension on possible Augmented reality applications and we will discuss about it in other parts.\nPlaying sound\nUsing package named sound_package and publishing unique sounds when the QR code are sucessfully decrypted.\ndef talker(self, datain):\n  Song_cmd = SongTitle()\n\n  if datain == \'TAG1_Greek\':\n    Song_cmd.song = 0;\n  elif datain == \'TAG2_Front\':\n    Song_cmd.song = 1;\n  elif datain == \'TAG3_France\':\n    Song_cmd.song = 2;\n  elif datain == \'TAG4_Rear\':\n    Song_cmd.song = 3;\n\n  self.song_pub.publish(Song_cmd)\n  rospy.sleep(1)\n\nCustom music tunes are played at each detection of QR code which was encoded by Fabio in our team.\nAdvantages and challenges of using PyZbar\nThis new method of PyZbar appears to be really powerful in order to read the information from the Qr code. Its detection is also really sensitive. If we mix this method to some pre-processing steps such as Hough circles, it can slightly improves the computation power required to read the Qr code and obtains information about it. We can also imagine a lot of Augmented reality applications linked with this field and we will discuss about it in the conclusion as a future work.\nSomehow, this method got also some really weak points. It appears to be sensitive to some really weak points. It appears to be sensitive to deformation and to motions. However, the motion problem could be fixed with pre-processing steps\nChallenges Faced\n\n\nThe navigation sometimes was disturbed because of the uneven surface. While translation would not be affected very much by the uneven surface, rotation on uneven surface was challenging.\n\n\nCoding for QR code detection and combining it with playing music on Kobuki was one of the most challenging tak we faced. The music wold not stop until the Kobuki base was reset.\n\n\nThe music also could not be played while the Kobuki base is moving and would jerk and stutter if done so. We are yet to figure out why that was the case.\n\n\nWe had to resort to create a python script from scratch in order to detect the QR code in the image accessed by Kinect\'s RGB camera. Here\'s is we would have prefered using a talker and listener approach, which we have but have to involve a lot of work arounds.\n\n\nWe tried to build a 3D depth map using packages such as rgbslam_v2. But given the time we had spent already on combining navigation and music playing on Kobuki base, we dropped further testing of 3D map building.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe have thus completed navigation, localization, mapping, QR code detection and publishing of music upon detection by the robot successfully.\nWe also learnt an important property of ROS. The talker and listener topics of ROS are a great way to learn about basics of operating system, since alot of process signals in Android, an operating system based on Linux, work the same way and this offers quite an insight in the basics of building an efficient system.\nAlthough we have arrived here through much trial and error, we were able to learn a lot about ROS. The main takeaways from the project were to breaking down of bigger problems into smaller ones and then working on it one at a time, instead of trying different packages which might work. We took the basics of what was taught in the class and through literature survey and help from online forums and our colleagues in the classroom, completed what we originally intended to do. For us, the results of the project are satisfactory but we look forward to improve and combine more capabilities into the Turtlebot in the future.\nReferences\nROS by Example, Volume 1\nWiki ROS Tutorials\nAll the other relevant used resources have been hyperlinked throughout the report itself.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/ankuku', 'info_list': ['11', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Nov 6, 2020', '293', 'Python', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Mar 3, 2021', '61', 'RobotFramework', 'MIT license', 'Updated Mar 5, 2021', '5', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 14, 2021', '3', 'C++', 'MIT license', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', '60', 'C++', 'Updated Jun 7, 2020', '8', 'C++', 'Updated Dec 22, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', '2', 'Kotlin', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 15, 2021', '1', 'Java', 'MIT license', 'Updated Sep 29, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/frc3324', 'info_list': ['11', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Nov 6, 2020', '293', 'Python', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Mar 3, 2021', '61', 'RobotFramework', 'MIT license', 'Updated Mar 5, 2021', '5', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 14, 2021', '3', 'C++', 'MIT license', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', '60', 'C++', 'Updated Jun 7, 2020', '8', 'C++', 'Updated Dec 22, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', '2', 'Kotlin', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 15, 2021', '1', 'Java', 'MIT license', 'Updated Sep 29, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['Team3749-2020\n🤖 Awesome code for the 2020 FIRST® Robotics Competition.\n\nRIP 2020\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Team-Optix-3749', 'info_list': ['11', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Nov 6, 2020', '293', 'Python', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Mar 3, 2021', '61', 'RobotFramework', 'MIT license', 'Updated Mar 5, 2021', '5', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 14, 2021', '3', 'C++', 'MIT license', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', '60', 'C++', 'Updated Jun 7, 2020', '8', 'C++', 'Updated Dec 22, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', '2', 'Kotlin', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 15, 2021', '1', 'Java', 'MIT license', 'Updated Sep 29, 2020']}"

It can test any kind of application with the help of libraries.\nCheckMK is a state-of-the-art IT infrastructure monitoring system.\nRobotMK integrates the results of Robot Framework into Checkmk. It bridges the gap between infrastructure and application testing.\n\nWhy do I need RobotMK?\nA monitoring system like Checkmk does a very good job to monitor your business\' IT infrastructure with checks for Servers, Network devices, etc.\nBut in the end - the reason why you are running IT is to provide a service to users.\nTherefore you shouldn\'t only monitor infrastructure, but also the services. And most important: do it like they do. Use a real browser, mouse and keyboard strokes. Test from End (the user) to End (your IT infrastructure as a whole). This is called ""End2End""-Testing.\nRobot Framework can automate End2End-Tests for you (and much more). Integrating those tests into CheckMK is a great supplement.\nRobotMK acts as a bridge between Robot Framework and CheckMK.\nState of development\nIs RobotMK stable? Can it be used in production?\nFortunately, the development of RobotMK is driven by customers who believe in the project and use already it in their daily business. This is where worthful feedback and feature requests come from.\nEven if they already use RobotMK in production there\'s no point denying the project is still in an early phase (= major version 0.x).\nAs bugs are getting solved and new features are coming in, there is no guarantee that after installing a new version of RobotMK settings, output formats etc. will be the same or at least compatible with the previous version. We try to communicate this in the CHANGELOG as detailled as possible.\nKey features/components\n\nRobotMK bakery rule - configures E2E clients:\n\nUse the CheckMK WATO rule editor to decide which remote hosts should be deployed with the RobotMK plugin.\nDefine which suites should be executed there and the individual parameters.\n\n\nRobotMK plugin - executes RF tests:\n\nintegrated into the CheckMK monitoring agent, it is a kind of wrapper for RF tests on the client side. It gets controlled by the robotmk YML file which is created by the bakery.\n\n\nRobotMK check - evaluates RF results:\n\nevaluates the RF result coming from the Checkmk agent.\n100% configurable by web (WATO), 100% Robot compatible: RobotMK does not require any adaptation to existing Robot tests; they can be integrated in CheckMK without any intervention.\npowerful pattern-based definition system for ""most general"" and/or fine granular control of\n\nruntime thresholds: get alarms for suites/tests/keywords running too long.\nperformance data: get graphs for any runtime. Even insidious performance changes can thus be detected.\nservice discovery level: rule-based splitting of Robot Framework results into different Checkmk services (""checks"" in CheckMK) - without splitting the robot test.\nreduction of the output to the essential needs for an optimum result.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the feature page of RobotMK to learn about its history, features and advantages.\nUsage scenarios\nRobotMK is great for:\n\nhaving both monitoring business-critical applications and infrastructure check within the same monitoring tool (Checkmk)\nmonitoring modern apps: Angular, React, Android/iOS based, ... Robot Framework has a long list of well-curated libraries\nmonitoring old legacy apps: even the oldest applications can be monitored with Robot Framework by using a image recognition based library.\nmonitoring 3rd party services: there are bunch of libraries to write tests based on REST, SOAP, TCP sockets, SSH, FTP, ...\n\nRequirements\nRobotMK works with any CheckMK 1.6x version and edition (CEE and CRE).\n\nEnterprise edition (CEE) is recommended if you want to benefit from the agent bakery system which creates agent installation packages and the RobotMK YAML configuration files.\nRaw Edition (CRE) also works if you are fine to write this files by hand/generate by some other tool (Ansible etc.). (Nevertheless, consider a worthwile switch to CEE)\n\nInstallation\nYou can choose between two ways of installing RobotMK:\n\nInstalling as MKP is the preferred way.\n\nThe most recent release can be downloaded here on the Releases page\nThe latest MKP reviewed by tribe29 (the Checkmk guys) can be fetched from CMK Exchange (not always up to date)\n\n\nInstallation by hand is only recommended for advanced users who love to get dirty hands.\n\n\nNow verify that checkMK can use the robotmk check:\n$ su - cmk\nOMD[cmk]:~$ cmk -L | grep robot                                          \nrobotmk     tcp    (no man page present)\n\nDocumentation\nAll Robotmk rules come with a very detailled and comprehensive context help. This covers 95% of all information which is needed to work with Robotmk.\nThe context help can be shown by clicking on the book icon in the top right corner of every RobotMK rule:\n\nUsage\nCaveat: the following information can contain minor differences to the current development state\nConfigure what to execute\nThis recording shows how easy it is to deploy the RobotMK to the host robothost1:\n\nGo to the WATO section ""Monitoring Agents"" -> Rules\nCreate a new RobotMK bakery rule\n\nWe set the Cache time to 5 minutes so that the plugin gets executed only every 5 minutes.\nsampletest is the name of a Robot test in the default agent lib folder (/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/robot, configurable). To bring Robot test to the client, use the WATO rule Deploy custom files with agent - but there is more to come :-)\nAs you can see, we can set most of the arguments we could also give to Robot on the CLI: rename the suite, pass variables, call variable files with parameters (yeah), etc...\nPiggyback allows you to assign the Robot result to another host than robothost1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bakery bakes a new RPM package containing the RobotMK plugin and the RobotMK YML file:\n\n# Created by Check_MK Agent Bakery.\n# This file is managed via WATO, do not edit manually or you\n# lose your changes next time when you update the agent.\n\ncache_time: 300\nconsole: \'\'\nlog: \'\'\nreport: \'\'\nrobotdir: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/robot\nsuites:\n  sampletest:\n    name: iwantanothername\n    variablefile:\n    - varfile.py:testing\n    variables:\n    - var1:value1\n    - var2:value2\n\nIntegrate the new Robot E2E check into CheckMK\nAs soon as the new agent is installed on the client, it starts to execute the robot test(s). You will notice that the service ""CheckMK Discovery"" turns to WARNING because it hs found the first result of out Robot test in the agent output. Let\'s integrate the new check into the monitoring!\n\nConfigure the E2E check\nNow we use the RobotMK rule for discovered services to\n\nset a threshold on Subsuite3 on 5 seconds\ndraw performance data for every Subsuite\n\n\nDiscovery level: split up a Robot tests into many CMK services\nLastly, we decide every ""Subsuite"" in the Robot test to be represented as an own CheckMK service.\n""Subsuite1-3"" are one (1) level deeper from the top result level. Hence, we use the Robot Framework Discovery Level rule to set the discovery level from 0 (top level) to 1.\nWhy would you want to do this?\n\nSee every test part in a dedicated monitoring check with its own state\nPerhaps you already have complex Robot tests and you do not want to tear them apart\nSend notifications for certain parts of the tests to individual contacts\nGenerate reports about different parts of the test (e.g. open application, login, report generation)\n\n\nDevelopment setup\nInstallation\nIt is assumed that you are developing on a Linux host which already has CheckMK installed. Instead of copying the files into the site (as described in Installation), just create symlinks (ln -s ) to the apropriate files and directories.\nPython versions\nThis project is based on two Python versions:\n\nPython 2.7 - robotmk check on the CheckMK Server (CheckMK will be running soon on Python3)\nPython 3.6 - robotmk plugin on the Robot test host\n\nTo run all tests, make sure that you have installed both versions on your machine.\ntox\ntox manages the virtual envs for us to run tests both for check and plugin within their proper environment.\nFirst, make sure that you have tox installed on your system. It is perfect to install tox in a virtual environment:\n~$ virtualenv ~/venv-tox\ncreated virtual environment CPython2.7.5.final.0-64 in 140ms\n  creator CPython2Posix(dest=/root/venv-tox, clear=False, global=False)\n  seeder FromAppData(download=False, pip=latest, setuptools=latest, wheel=latest, via=copy, app_data_dir=/root/.local/share/virtualenv/seed-app-data/v1.0.1)\n  activators PythonActivator,CShellActivator,FishActivator,PowerShellActivator,BashActivator\n~$ . ~/venv-tox/bin/activate\n(venv-tox) ~$ pip install tox\n(venv-tox) ~$ tox --version\n3.15.1 imported from /root/venv-tox/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tox/__init__.pyc\n\nrunning tests with tox\nWith tox installed now, the tests can be started:\n# run tests for the plugin (Python 3.6) and the check (Python 2.7)\ntox\n# run only plugin tests\ntox -e plugin \n# run only check tests\ntox -e check\n\nSubmodule init\nAll tests rely on the Python test module python-pytest-check_mk, for which two pull requests are waiting.\nAs long as the pull reqeusts (1 and 2)  are outstanding, the forked version of python-pytest-check_mk is included as a git submodule. tox (see next section) takes care about the initialisation, so there is no work for you.\nThe manual step to update the submodule is:\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n\nDebugging the RobotMK check\nipdb is a great cmdline debugger for Python. In the following example it is shown how to execute the RobotMK check within the cmk context.\nA breakpoint in line 120 is set with ""b"":\nOMD[cmk]:~$ python -m ipdb bin/cmk -IIv test2Win10simdows\n> /opt/omd/sites/cmk/bin/cmk(34)<module>()\n     33\n---> 34 import os\n     35 import sys\n\nipdb> b /omd/sites/cmk/local/share/check_mk/checks/robotmk:120\nBreakpoint 1 at /omd/sites/cmk/local/share/check_mk/checks/robotmk:120\nipdb> r\nDiscovering services on: test2Win10simdows\ntest2Win10simdows:\n+ FETCHING DATA\n [agent] Execute data source\n [piggyback] Execute data source\nNo piggyback files for \'test2Win10simdows\'.

If not,\nthis is currently very hard to detect because only the MK discovery check warns that the\n<<<robotmk>>> agent section is missing. This meta-process will be called robotmk-master.\nRead more about this in issue 59\nIt is helpful to have also Robot Logs at hand when there is an alarm. It is planned\nthat the RobotMK plugin also collects the Robot HTML logs and transfers them to the\nCMK server. HTML logs could also include (embedded?) screenshots, animated GIF screen-recordings etc.\nThe goal is to implement a service action button which guides you directly to the most\nrecent Robot Log. Read more about this idea in issue #1.\nCreate a complete Docker-based test setup which covers all test scenarios. Why not test RobotMK\'s functionality with Robot/Selenium itself.\nCreate a Docker container to execute Robot tests also in Containers. Expand the agent plugin to trigger Robot containers with API calls to Kubernetes and Docker Swarm to distribute E2E tests.\nCreate dynamic area-stacked performance graphs in the CheckMK grapher. (No, I won\'t do this for PNP4Nagios...)\n\nContributing\nIf you want to help RobotMK to get better, you\'re warmly welcomed!\n\nFork this project\nCreate a feature branch with a name containing the issue number (or submit a new issue first), from the current develop branch.\nAlways and often rebase your feature branch from develop\nPull requests are welcome if they can be merged and solve a problem\n\nLicense\nRobotMK is published unter the GNU General Public License v3.0\nCredits/Thanks\nContributions\nThanks to the following people who help to make RobotMK better by submitting code:\n\nMichael FRANK (contributed to the agent plugin)\nGuillaume DURVILLE (contributed to the bakery rule)\n\nSupporters\nThanks to the companies which support the development of RobotMK:\n\nITERATIO GmbH, Cologne (GER) - Hardy DÜTTMANN\ncomNET GmbH, Hannover (GER) - Thorben Söhl\nAbraxas Informatik AG, St. Gallen (CH) -  Jens Dunkelberg\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/simonmeggle', 'info_list': ['2', 'Java', 'MIT license', 'Updated Mar 2, 2021', '3', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 27, 2021', '23', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 4, 2021', '5', 'Java', 'Updated Sep 13, 2020', '2', 'Python', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Feb 28, 2021', '3', 'C#', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated May 8, 2020', '3', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', '24', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Dec 23, 2019', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 6, 2021']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': [""FRC2020_Infinite_Recharge\nTeam 4183's repository for our Infinite Recharge robot's code\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/BitBucketsFRC4183', 'info_list': ['2', 'Java', 'MIT license', 'Updated Mar 2, 2021', '3', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 27, 2021', '23', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 4, 2021', '5', 'Java', 'Updated Sep 13, 2020', '2', 'Python', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Feb 28, 2021', '3', 'C#', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated May 8, 2020', '3', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', '24', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Dec 23, 2019', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 6, 2021']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': [""pyinfiniterecharge\n\nThe Drop Bears' robot code for FIRST Infinite Recharge (FRC 2020-2021).\nInstall dependencies\nOn a computer:\npip3 install -r requirements-sim.txt\n\nFor the roboRIO:\n# Online:\nrobotpy-installer download-python\nrobotpy-installer download -r requirements.txt\n\n# On the robot network:\nrobotpy-installer install-python\nrobotpy-installer install -r requirements.txt\nCode style\nThis codebase adheres to the code style enforced by the black autoformatter:\nblack .\n\nThis is enforced by CI.

As a Misty developer, you can use the code and documentation in this repository to quickly build and deploy skills that put Misty to work as a concierge in industries like hospitality, healthcare, education, eldercare, commercial real estate, retail, marketing, and even museums.\nRepository Contents\nThis repository provides templates for building a concierge skill using Misty's JavaScript and .NET (Beta) SDKs. It includes the following subdirectories:\n\nJavaScript - The original JavaScript implementation of the Misty Concierge Template, built with Misty's JavaScript SDK. Use the README in this directory to get started with the JavaScript version of the template.\nC# - A C# implementation of the Misty Concierge Template, built with Misty's .NET SDK (Beta). Use the README in this directory to get started with a C# version of the template.\nimg - Images and screenshots used in the documentation for this repository.\n\nThe skills you build with these templates focus on information sharing. Each template integrates with Dialogflow and other third-party APIs to give Misty the ability to handle voice interactions, answer questions, and look up information. As she listens and responds, Misty maintains eye contact with the speaker, moves her head and arms, blinks her LED, plays sounds, and changes her expression to invite engagement and delight those who speak to her. All of this interaction is built into the template for you to customize and build on for your own use case.\nYou can extend these templates to put Misty to work in a number of ways. For example:\n\nMisty could answer questions about local events, what's on the menu for dinner, or what the weather is like.\nShe could take reservations and order tickets, or help with room service orders via further integrations with 3rd party services and point-of-sale systems.\nYou could ask Misty to book cars or taxis.\nMisty could tell fun facts, tell jokes, or play games.\nYou could ask Misty to page someone by sending an SMS through a service like Twilio.\nWith other IoT integrations, Misty could control your smart home devices.\nMisty could be a personal assistant who can review your schedule and set reminders.\n\nContribution Guidelines\nIf you'd like to extend the templates, work on open issues, improve the documentation, add examples built on other services, or have ideas for other ways to advance the project, please feel free to submit a pull request.\nTo learn more about the technologies used in this project, check out these resources:\n\nMisty II JavaScript SDK docs\nMisty II .NET SDK (Beta) docs\nDialogflow docs\nFoursquare Places API docs\n\nNew to contributing to open source?

To enable it, you will need to run\nupdate-hooks.bat on Windows or gradlew installGitHooks on Linux and macOS.\nArchitecture Highlights\n\nMultithreading Support\n\nRoboRio has a 2 Core Processor and supports paralization. A good example of this is utilizing a secondary thread for vision communication.\n\n\nField Relative Controls\n\nWe may find that subsystems would be better suited with field based controls.\n\nTurret for example, Don\'t force the drivers to have to overthink where the turret will be\n\n\n\n\nSingleton Class approach\n\nFor many of the classes, like the subsytems, force the system to use a singelton method. Guard nesscary methods with a synchronized keyword.\n\n\nBackplane Approach\n\nThe general contept is to expose as much logic as possible to the Robot.java class. For example the drive operation is called from Robot.java.\nThe concept behind this is easier thinking at a systems level.\nDrive as much logic in the RobotLoop function found in the Robot.java.\n\n\nSubsystem Subclass and Subsystem Manager\n\nAll subsystems must extend the abstract subsystem class\nThis adds subsystems automatically to the constructor via the abstract class\nIntialially all this really is used for is to quickly loop through all the subsystems and run a subsystem check.\n\n\nSubsystem Checks\n\nAll Subsystem classes must extend the Subsystem class. Within that class is a Subsystem Check Class.\nIf we intend on playing deep into playoff matchups, it is likely we will encounter a match with a fast turnaround to the next match. It would be good to have a fast and effective functional that could give us some confidence.\n\n\nRobotState\n\nEssentially just a position Tracker for the robot. Record Pose2D at points.\n\n\nDisabled States\n\nLikely not super useful, but we may find the need to perform periodic actions in a disabled state.\n\n\nPath Planning\n\nFound in the Utility Libaries, we inherit 254\'s path planning logic. Using this logic we can drive waypoints. This library does an excellent job at pushing the robot\'s capabilites through spines while maintaining accuracy.\n\n\n\nBrainstorming Ideas\n\n\'Playbook\'\n\nGame permitting, we might find there are tasks that we will need to repeat often. For example, say if we are picking up a scoring object at a feeder station and want to make an immediate drive to a scoring station. A simple look at this would be:\n\nLoad Game Object -> Driver triggers playbook -> Robot performs autonomous drive to location -> Trigger Camera or other sensor Feedback -> Score Object\nDirectional Pad on controller could be a good control to do this.\n\n\n\n\nPreset Control\n\nAll Manipulators should have a \'state\' based focus. With a state based system we should rely on PID Control to reach exact points\n\n\nSmartNav\n\nConcepts\n\n\nPhysics\nWe adopt some physic concepts that teams like 254 used (which are now included in the WPILIB apparently). Here is a brief explanation of each.\n\nKinematics\n\nBranch of classical mechanics (physics of motion) that describes the motion of an object without knowing anything about the forces acting on the object.\nForward Kinematics\n\nConvert positions of the robot to overal robot position\nAn example of this would be in a 2 jointed arm, forward kinematics would calculate the position of the end of the entire arm based on the angle of each joint\nRobot Drive Example: Forward Kinematics determines position of drivebased based on position of the left and right sides of the drive base\n\n\nInverse Kinematics\n\nDetermines position of parts of the robot based on the robot position. The inverse of forward kinematics\nOn a 2 jointed arm, if we have a target location of where we want the end to be, we can calculate what angle each joint has to be to reach that position\nRobot Drive Example: Determines left and right wheel speeds based on commanded velocities\n\n\n\n\nPose2D (Rigid Transformation)\n\nA transformation is when you take a shape and you move it in some way. A rigid transformation includes rotations, translations, and reflections.\nRotation rotates the shape around a center point. Each rotation has a direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise), center point and degree of rotation\nTranslation is a sliding of a shape. An easy example is sliding a book 5 inches to the left on a bookshelf, this would be a translation. If we were zero\'ed, on an x, y coordinate grid, then you could say you were moving the book along the x accesses.\nReflections are pretty simply. Results in flipping the shape across some line. These aren\'t overly useful in our case.\nEach Pose2D contains a Translation2D Object and a Rotation2D Object. Essientally just a rotation vector and a position vector\n\n\nTranslation2D\n\nTranslation in X and Y. Often times this is essentially used as an X, Y point for the robot on the field. PathSegment.java\'s constructor shows how this is done.\n\n\nRotation2D\n\nSimply a point on the unit circle (cosine and sine). Basically represents a rotation of the robot. You can think of this like the Robot is in the center of a Unit Circle, with values plugged into Cos, Sin functions to pinpoint the robots rotation.\n\n\nCoordinate Frame\n\nX,Y point on a field, and a direction. In this case a Translation2D object would represent an X,Y position, and a Rotation2D object is the rotation. We will take a Coordinate frame upon robot intialization.\n\n\n\n\n\nPID\n\nProportional, Integral, Derivative\n\n\n\nMotion Profiles\n\nJerk, Acceleration, Velocity, Position\nFigure out where you want to go\nFind a path\nFInd a trajectory\nFollow the trajectory\n\nFigure out where you should be right now\nFeedforware control + Feedback control\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulator\nWPILib has simulator capability. We should utilize this simulator to simulate controller input early/motor output on the build season to iron out any glaring issues.\nhttps://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-simulation/introduction.html\nCode Housekeeping\nWe want our code to execute as efficiently as possible.\n\nMake use of primitives types. Use int and double instead of Integer and Double. The JVM is able to store primitive types in the stack instead of the heap.\nAvoid using the ""+"" operator to concatenate strings when you need to concatenate the result again in a different statement.\n\nSee This StackOverflow Answer\nTL;DR: The compiler will translate concatenations to StringBuilder operations, but in some cases this may not be optimal.\n\n\nUse a leading \'m\' on instance variables int mInstanceVariable = 0;\nUse a leading \'s\' on static (""class"") variables int sClassVariable = 0;\nUse a leading k on Constants kDriveSpeed\nDefine all constants in Constants.java, to avoid reusing memory on the stack as needed\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Team138Entropy', 'info_list': ['9', 'TypeScript', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 28, 2020', '3', 'Java', 'Updated Jul 14, 2020', '5', 'Java', 'Updated Nov 6, 2020', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated May 24, 2020', 'C#', 'Updated Dec 30, 2019']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '0 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Robotics\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/WheelsonLol', 'info_list': ['9', 'TypeScript', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 28, 2020', '3', 'Java', 'Updated Jul 14, 2020', '5', 'Java', 'Updated Nov 6, 2020', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated May 24, 2020', 'C#', 'Updated Dec 30, 2019']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '0 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/matthewgoldst', 'info_list': ['9', 'TypeScript', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 28, 2020', '3', 'Java', 'Updated Jul 14, 2020', '5', 'Java', 'Updated Nov 6, 2020', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated May 24, 2020', 'C#', 'Updated Dec 30, 2019']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '26 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': [""robotics\na. Image capture and preprocessing\nThe main program is imageforrobotics.m, a function file distance.m is also necessary. The recognition result is illustrated by done_recogn.jpg.\n\nFigure 1. captured sample image\nThis is an image we captured, first use *imread* function to load this image. Because it’s a RGB image and has three channels, use *rgb2gray* to convert it into grayscale image. This image contains useless content like the big chunk of black on the left, so just cut the image into half and take the right half. Personally, we are used to have the origin at down left, so flip the picture before processing.\nTransform this image to black and white image according to the histogram, we set the threshold to 100.\nFigure 2. the histogram of cut picture\nSo it is obvious all the pixels with value under 100 should be set to 1, and the others set to 0. But there are many tiny blocks around the objects and targets.\n\nFigure 3. visible tiny blocks around the objects\nFor this issue, call the function bwlabel, which has input as a black and white image and labels all the region with more than 4 connecting 1s from index 1 to the number of blocks. The return value of this function is the labeled figure and number of objects. Traverse all the indices in the labeled figure L\nfor i=1:n\n\n  [r, c]=find(L==i);\n\n if length(r)<=30\n\n   L(find(L==i))=0;\n\n end\n\nend\nAny block whose number of non-zero values less than 30 is set to zero, the threshold 30 is an experimentally determined value, varies according to different situation. Now it’s time to call bwlabel again.\nb. Scaling factor estimation\nTo compute the scaling factor, we can measure the length of the side of base frame and count the number of pixels in that side, then divide the length by pixels, the result is scaling factor.\nTo realize this method, first we have to locate the base frame. It is pretty obvious the base frame has the biggest size among all the objects and targets. First we make a loop, the iterator can be used as the index to extract blocks in the labeled figure. Among all the indices, find out the index whose corresponding block has the biggest number of points and save this index as index for base.\nFind function will find all the points whose value(index) are the same as its parameter in the given picture\n\nFigure 4. labeled figure with interference removed\nand return the indices of all the points as a vector of N by 2, N is the number of points. After we find them , take this range of pixels out to create a small figure, only contains the points with this index. Of course, edge extraction also helps, edge(subfigure,'sobel'); is the key to extracting edge. To locate the origin, we just need to find 4 points: the upmost leftmost point, the leftmost upmost point, the leftmost downmost point, and the downmost leftmost point. The upmost leftmost point is located by finding the points have smallest row indices, then find the point has the smallest column index among them; and the leftmost upmost point is determined by finding the points having the smallest column indices, then find the point with the smallest row index, et cetera.\nThere are three possibilities:\n\nFigure 5. three possible orientations for base frame\nUnder these situations, the choice of origin is different, but the basic idea is telling them apart by comparing the column indices of four key points. For example, for image in the middle, we should pick the leftmost upmost point or the leftmost downmost point as origin, and save this coordinate. To know the length for the side, another point should be determined. In the first situation, the leftmost upmost point is chosen for computing distance with origin. Computing the distance between two points on an image is the same as computing distance on cartesian plane.\nfunction [d]=distance(x1,y1,x2,y2)\nd=sqrt( (x1-x2)^2+(y1-y2)^2  );\nend\n\nWe just need two sets of coordinates indicating the beginning and the end of string. The result is defined in pixel space, not in real world, the length of base frame’s side is 6cm.\n\nSo in order to get any coordinates in real world refer to base frame, just multiply the coordinates in pixels with the scaling factor.\nc. Segmentation and recognition of objects in various poses for each of the 4 possible shapes\nFirst of all, keep in mind that all the blocks on the image no matter it’s target or object, are all indexed with number from 2 to 9(index 1 is the base frame). So it makes it easier for us to do segmentation.\n[r, c]=find(L==i); %i is the iterator, used as index\n     icell{i}=L(max(1,min(r)-extension):min(max(r)+extension,r_L),max(1,min(c)-  …  \nextension):min(max(c)+extension,r_L)); %extract the block from the labeled image\n   index{i}=[r,c];\n\nThe result of this code is a subfigure from indexed original indexed image.\n\nFigure 6. subfigure of objects\nRecognition of shape\nIn order to recognize the shape, we still need the four key points mentioned above, besides, the center point is also needed. The coordinate of the center point is computed by computing the average of all the rows and columns. Also, in this circumstance, extracting the edge is still helpful.\n\nFigure 7. the center point of an object\nFor rectangular, an important property is that one side is longer than another side. This makes it easier to recognize a rectangular. In brief, as long as one side is longer than another side and the absolute result of this subtraction is bigger than 30(a experimentally determined value), which means one side should longer than another one for at least 30 pixels.\nThe length of the sides are determined by computing the distance between two key points, and errors happen when the edge is not straight then one or more than one of the key points are not located on the corner of rectangular, which makes two points too close. So another constraint should be considered: the distance between any of two key points should be at least bigger than 30(experimentally determined).\nAbout how to tell the object and the target apart, just check the number of edges in the subfigure are 1 or 2. This is done by conduct bwlabel again in the subfigure.\n\nFigure 8. the edges of target\nRecognition of triangle\nTriangular has two possible conditions:\n\nFigure 9. one of possible orientation of triangular\nAnother possible condition is the three key points distributed on three corners of triangle. For the first situation, just need to test if the minimum of distance between any two key points is smaller than 10(arbitrarily determined). Beside this, the other situation is more tricky. Because this is an equilateral triangle, three sides should be in the same length. The law is that if the maximum of the absolute result of subtraction between any two sides minus the minimum of the absolute result of subtraction between any two sides smaller than 10(also arbitrarily decided).\nBecause the shape recognized is useless for the subsequent recognition task, we use a series of *if* and *else*, once this shape meets one of the conditions, stop judging and move on to the next recognition session.\nRecognition of circle\nThe recognition of circle is not so assured. Here we use the property that all the points on a circle has the same distance towards the center of the circle.\n\nFigure 10. the middle point(yellow point on the circle and square)\nHere we find a point whose column is in the middle between center point and the rightmost downmost point, and it’s on the edge, or, the shape. So the mission is to tell if the distance between the rightmost downmost point and the center point is the same with the distance between the middle point and the center point, or if their difference is below 10. Experiments show that this method works under rather ideal situations.\nRecognition of square\nThe method to recognize square is by its size, if the two sides of square multiply together and the result is similar to the size of square block(or the difference between them is under 1200), we can say it is a square.\nd. Objects and targets’ position estimation\nThe position is simply the center point of each block, which is elaborated above about how to compute. Unfortunately, that’s only the position in the image space, and the distance and coordinate are all in pixels. So the key is to multiple the scaling factor. According to the transformation graph, we know:\n$$\nQ_{obj|base} = Q_{ref|base} * Q_{obj|ref}\n$$\nis easy to compute, now it’s time to compute. As we can see from Figure 11., the x axis is pointing up, so the distance along x axis actually corresponds the difference of rows, and the distance along y axis corresponds the difference of columns. So the x coordinate of an object is calculated by subtracting the row number of center point of an object by the row value of the origin, and then do the same thing to y coordinate. Finally, we have the (x, y) coordinate.\n\nFigure 11. the base reference frame\ne. Objects’ orientation estimation\nThe orientation is relatively easier than shape recognition. We don’t have to do anything to circles, orientation doesn’t work for them. The most tough part is determining the orientation of triangles and rectangles. For rectangle, the orientation is important because the gripper can only grip the object across the shorter side. The judgement is simple: if a side is longer than the other side, then compute the middle point of the shorter side, connect this point and the center point to form a line, the orientation of this line is also the orientation of this rectangular, and notice that this line is actually the x axis of this object, so our target is to overlap the x axis of gripper and the object.\n\nFigure 12. line up the middle point and center point\nThe calculation of angle uses the atan2 function, and input needs the coordinate of two points.\ntheta_rect_t=rad2deg(atan2(mid_c-mean_pix_sub(2) ,mean_pix_sub(1)-mid_r ));\nThe code implements the equation:\n\nBecause the x axis of base reference is pointing up, and y axis is pointing to right, the  in the Figure 12. is negative. For another orientation of rectangle, the  is positive, and equation is the same:\n\nFigure 13. another orientation for rectangle\nFor the orientation of triangles, a corner is crucial, for the triangle is equilateral, any one of the three corners is fine for determining the orientation. Here we pick the leftmost upmost point and line up it with the center point.\n\nFigure 14. triangle orientation\nThe computation of angle is the same as in rectangle, because they both have a line representing the orientation.\nFinally, the orientation of square is similar to rectangle but we don’t need to figure out which side is longer. Just pick one side and calculate the middle point and the angle.\n\nFigure 15. square orientation\nf. Implementation\nFor every object and target, we create a cell for them, this cell stores a set of coordinates of coordinates in real length(cm) refer to base frame. So whenever we need them, just take them out. The inverse kinematics requires Q matrices of final configuration, that is to say, the Q matrices of objects, and also of the gripper.\n\nThis is as the output of image processing part and because MATLAB has the workspace shares all the variables among the files, we can run the inverse kinematics after the image processing part.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/brunosram', 'info_list': ['9', 'TypeScript', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 28, 2020', '3', 'Java', 'Updated Jul 14, 2020', '5', 'Java', 'Updated Nov 6, 2020', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated May 24, 2020', 'C#', 'Updated Dec 30, 2019']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': [""2020-robotics-code\nTeam 5427's robotics code for the 2020 FRC Challenge: Infinite Recharge\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Team5427', 'info_list': ['9', 'TypeScript', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 28, 2020', '3', 'Java', 'Updated Jul 14, 2020', '5', 'Java', 'Updated Nov 6, 2020', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated May 24, 2020', 'C#', 'Updated Dec 30, 2019']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '317 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Robotics\nHere, I would uploading my works as I learn new things in the field of robotics.\nColor Threshold:\nThis is done in order to understand the concept of color threshold.

Intended as a hobby exercise in RaspberryPi, Python and GIT.\nBackground/Components\nRubiks cube solving robot built from Legos, Raspberry Pi 3, Dexter BrickPi3, solved and controlled using libraries written in Python 2.7\nThe project is closely based on the original BricKuber project from Dexter Industries and has the following components:\n\nRaspberry Pi - Will take pictures of the unsolved cube, process the solution and command the BrickPi.\nBrickPi3 - Will controll the Lego motors.\nRaspberr Pi Camera - Will take pictures of the unsolved cube.\nRaspbian for Robots - Loaded onto an SD card, is the operating system for the Raspberry Pi.\nLEGO Mindstorm - Will be used to build the actual robot that solves the cube.\nrubiks-color-tracker - Python library used to convert an image of a cube into RGB values for each square.\nBrickPi3 - BrickPi3 drivers (https://github.com/DexterInd/BrickPi3/blob/master/Software/Python/brickpi3.py)\nJBRIK - Source code from this project written to solve the cube.\n\nmotor_core - Wrapper library around Dexter Ind. LEGO motor drivers.  Controls articulation of the robot.\nsolver_core - Routines to solve each phase of the cube.\ntracker_core\nresolver - Routines used to convert RGB values corresponding to cube tiles into closest fit colors of the cube.\ntracker - Routines used to identify tiles on the cube faces and convert to RGB values.\n\n\n\nAlogorithms used to solve the cube: https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube-beginners-method/\nSetup/Installation\nMy prefered method of installation is using virtualenv.  You need only make sure that you have the dependencies listed in setup.py installed in order to run jbrik.  It's assumed that you're running on a RaspberryPi with Raspian for Robots with a BrickPi attached as well so there's an implied dependency on you having the BrickPi drivers to run the LEGO servos.\ngit clone https://github.com/jdvcDev/jbrik.git\ncd jbrik\nvirtualenv --python=<path to python version> ./venv\nsource venv/Scripts/activate\npip install .\nRunning/Example\n\nTo run the solver:\npython jbrik.py\nThe solver will perform the following sequence:\n\njbrik motor callibration.\nA photo is take of each face of the cube.\nThe photos are interpreted by the tracker routines, each colored tile is extracted and converted to an RBG value.\nThe RGB values are input into the rosolver routines, the final output is a string colored tiles values representing the state of the cube.  For example:\n\noogrwgwyrrgbwobyrygwbyyrwgwowowrobbyoggrgbwyrboyobyrbg\n\nThe cube state string is input to the solver routines that will progress through 7 stages of solving the cube with each stage's solution represented by a list of movements required to solve that phase of the cube, each movement described by a face, a direction and the number of 90 degree movements.  For example:\n\n[3CW2],[1CC1],[4CW1]...\n\nThe list of solution movements are then sent to the motor routines which execute the corresponding motor movements (flip, grab, rotate cube, rotate face) required to perform the movement.\n\nThe entire process takes roughly ten minutes depending on how many photos the solver is configured to take per face and how many movements are required to solve the cube.\nExample Run\n\nChallenges\nLighting\nGetting the tracker library to correctly resolve the face tiles to RGB values was difficult at times.  It would often fail to correctly identify colors, most often orange would be resolved as red and yellow as white.  At times the tracker would see reflections in the face of the cube and inaccurately identify these lighting transitions as unique tiles on the face.\n\nI approached this with several different solutions beggining with lighting placement.  Ultimately, direct light makes the problem worse and I was unable to find a consistent lighting position that would produce consistent results.\nI attempted to brute force the problem by taking an initial picture of the cube face, rotate the cube 90 degrees followed by another picture, etc. until I had 4 total pictures of the face.  I then converted each picture to the 9 unique RGB values correspong to the tiles on the given face, adjusted internal state representation of the individual tile locations to adjust for rotation, then used each of 4 unique RGB values for each tile to determine an aggregate average of the observed colors distance to each of the known cube colors... clear as mudd?  This worked, intermittently.  I found the tracker library was at times failing to identify an entire row of tiles (usually the top) which resulted in tiles being interpreted in the wrong order, or ultimately missing altogether.\nEventually I decided on building a light box to operate the machine in.  This provided consistent non direct lighting and allowed me to revert to only one photo per cube face.\n\nNearest cube color match\nIdentifying the nearest cube known color for each RGB was challenging as well.  I initially attempted to use the color resolver library implemented by dwalton76 (author of the tracker lib) but found the implementation to be tightly coupled to the usage of the kociemba algorithm.  That is the majority of the implementation is built around converting the observed RGB values into a kociemba string.  Given I chose to implement my own solving algorithms it was more challenging to adopt the resolve code than to write my own resolver as well.  I experimented with various color math processes related to finding the lowest distance to the known cube colors, including an aggregate average across multiple picture as described above but ultimately I ended up using LAB color space and found lighting to be the primary issue.  Finally, it took some experimentation with how to set RGB values for the known cube colors as colors differ by cube implementation, a standard cube vs a speed cube being the two implementations I was using to prototype.\nCube flipping\nI found that while running the solution set, that is, performing the motor movements to solve the cube, about 1 out of 100 moves would result in the machines grabber arm failing to flip the cube properly.  I experimented with several different speeds and movement ranges in an attempt to mitigate that but ulimately ended up resolving the issue by using a standard cube (vs a speed cube) due to its weight.  The machine seems to handle a heavier weighted cube better than a light one.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/jdvcDev', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'C#', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 22, 2021', '9', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', '8', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 1, 2020', 'Updated Jan 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 24, 2021', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 1, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'Updated Dec 30, 2019']}","{'location': 'Earth...', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '46 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/eric-erki', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'C#', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 22, 2021', '9', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', '8', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 1, 2020', 'Updated Jan 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 24, 2021', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 1, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'Updated Dec 30, 2019']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': [""2020InfiniteRecharge\nTeam 997's, Spartan Robotics, repository for the 2020 FRC game, Infinite Recharge\nMake sure you have the correct version of Team997Coders/SpartanLib in the same directory as this repo\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Team997Coders', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'C#', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 22, 2021', '9', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', '8', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 1, 2020', 'Updated Jan 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 24, 2021', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 1, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'Updated Dec 30, 2019']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '1 contribution\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/sreasearcher', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'C#', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 22, 2021', '9', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', '8', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 1, 2020', 'Updated Jan 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 24, 2021', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 1, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'Updated Dec 30, 2019']}","{'location': 'Atlanta, GA', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '536 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/zachlloyd01', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'C#', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 22, 2021', '9', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', '8', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 1, 2020', 'Updated Jan 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 24, 2021', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 1, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'Updated Dec 30, 2019']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '0 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/faseelapm91', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'C#', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 22, 2021', '9', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', '8', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 1, 2020', 'Updated Jan 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 24, 2021', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 1, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'Updated Dec 30, 2019']}"

Βέβαια, τα τελευταία χρόνια παρατηρείται μία αύξηση των μικρών και των καλλιεργήσιμων εκτάσεων ακόμα και σε αστικές περιοχές. Και καθώς όλο και περισσότερος κόσμος ενδιαφέρεται για τον τρόπο με τον οποίο παράγεται η πρώτη ύλη, πολλοί αρχίζουν να δημιουργούν μικρούς κήπους στις αυλές των σπιτιών τους, ώστε να παράγουν τα δικά τους λαχανικά. Εκεί λόγω κόστους αλλά και πολύ περιορισμένων επιλογών δεν έχουν εφαρμοστεί στον ίδιο βαθμό αυτόματες διαδικασίες. Όμως αυτές είναι απαραίτητες καθώς οι περισσότεροι δεν έχουν αρκετό χρόνο να διαθέσουν και δεν έχουν και τις απαραίτητες γνώσεις για να περιποιηθούν κατάλληλα τα φυτά τους.\nΒέβαια, δίπλα στα φυτά είναι πολύ κοινό να εμφανίζονται ζιζάνια, τα οποία το δυσκολεύουν από το να μεγαλώσει. Για τον λόγο αυτό είναι απαραίτητο να καταπολεμηθούν. Οι τρόποι καταπολέμησης τους είναι είτε με το ράντισμα τους με ζιζανιοκτόνα, πρακτική που συνηθίζεται για μεγάλες εκτάσεις, είτε με το ξερίζωμα τους από το έδαφος για μικρότερες εκτάσεις. Μια νέα έρευνα υποστηρίζει ότι το απλό κούρεμα του ζιζανίου είναι πιο αποδοτικό από το ξερίζωμα του, καθώς στις ρίζες του ζιζανίου διατηρούνται συστατικά αρκετά θρεπτικά για το φυτό.\nΗ λύση μας :\nΗ ιδέα μας ήταν η κατασκευή ενός αυτόνομου οχήματος για την αποψίλωση των ζιζανίων και την διαχείριση κήπων ή μικρών εκτάσεων. Πέρα από την αποψίλωση των φυτών το ρομπότ λαμβάνει επίσης σημαντικές μετρήσεις από το έδαφος και θα ρυθμίζει ανάλογα το πότισμα των φυτών. Το ξεχορτάριασμα γίνεται μέσω ειδικού μηχανισμού ο οποίος θα κόβει τις άκρες από τα χόρτα αντί να τα βγάζει από το έδαφος. Επίσης, μέσω κατάλληλου αισθητήρα το ρομπότ είναι σε θέση να μετράει την υγρασία του εδάφους γύρω από το κάθε φυτό. Μετά από επεξεργασία των δεδομένων αυτών θα ρυθμίζει ανάλογα τη συσκευή αυτόματου ποτίσματος των φυτών.\nΤρόπος λειτουργίας:\nΣτον κήπο έχουμε φυτέψει φυτά σε σειρές.\nΑνάμεσα στις σειρές αλλά και μεταξύ των φυτών υπάρχει ικανή απόσταση ώστε να μπορεί να περάσει το ρομπότ.\nΜπροστά από κάθε φυτό υπάρχει ένα ταμπελάκι στο ύψος του πλαϊνού αισθητήρα απόστασης, που χρησιμεύει ώστε το ρομπότ να ανιχνεύσει το κάθε φυτό.\n\nΑλγόριθμος\nΕνεργοποιείται ο dc κινητήρας του κοπτικού.\nΠροχωράμε μπροστά.\nΑν ο δεξιά ultrasonic δει ένα αντικείμενο (ταμπελάκι φυτού) σε απόσταση 45cm,\n    Τότε στρίβει δεξιά.\n    Προχωράει μπροστά μέχρι να βρει το φυτό.\n    Έπειτα μετράει την υγρασία εδάφους.\n    Παίρνει απόφαση για το εάν το φυτό θέλει πότισμα.\n    Όταν τελειώσει την διαδικασία αυτή επιστρέφει στη θέση του, στην κεντρική λεωφόρο.\nΑφού κάνει την διαδικασία αυτή σε όλα τα λουλούδια μιας σειράς και φτάσει στο τέλος της κεντρικής λεωφόρου κάνει αναστροφή.\nΑν δει εμπόδιο περιμένει δέκα δευτερόλεπτα και ξαναελέγχει.\n    Αν το εμπόδιο έχει απομακρυνθεί τότε το ρομπότ συνεχίζει ευθεία.\n    Αν το εμπόδιο παραμένει στο σημείο τότε το ρομπότ κάνει κίνηση ώστε να περάσει γύρω από το εμπόδιο.\n\nΗ ομάδα μας :\nΗ ομάδα μας αποτελείται από μικρούς ρομποτιστές, μαθητές Δημοτικών σχολείων της Πάτρας, μέλη της δράσης εκπαιδευτικής ρομποτικής ""Robots@ΜΕΤ"" του Πανεπιστημίου Πατρών.\nΥλικά κατασκευής (και ενδεικτικές τιμές):\n(x1) Arduino Uno – 15 €\n(x1) Σασί ρομπότ -

I had no idea until someone suggested a way to search for a movie, then see the show times in all the theaters closest to you. At this point, I know that I can search for movies, but I cannot get the top 10 or whatever because fandango is closed api. So bummer. But, luckally I found OMDB which allows me to search. I don\'t think I\'ll need to implement the google maps API for plotting at this point as it is time consuming, but, that may be a feature I add later.\nThe Flow\n\nThe user will enter a title of a movie into a form\nThe user will be presented with result\n\nIf no result, return \'no results\'\n\n\nIf there is a result\n\nThe application will show the user show times at theaters in a specified area.\n\n\n\nServices\nI have created a request service that will handle all of the complicated stuff needed to send out a request to all of the apis I use. This will also expose an internal api that will be consumed in components.\n\nservices/request_service.js\n\nComponents\nForms\nI will not be using a form library like formik or redux-form, instead, I\'ll just use react hooks. The forms should be able to validate user input, handle submission and any errors. The form should also be able to pass the result to another component.\nI did use a guide and I to check it out. Click here\nIn a nutshell, this guide pulls all the basic functionallity out of the formik library. In the end, I probably should have just used formik, but it was a learning experience for me.\nForm Sanitizer\nForm sanitizing is important and the way it is now build is as an extensible workflow. So if in addition to strings, I wanted to sanitize numbers or something, I could create a special sanitizing function for that. It also works on a copy and therefore doesn\'t modify the original inputs.\nDay 0\nI only had a few hours to get started working on the project. I set up the basic skeleton of the project as well as began researching ideas, tooling and apis I could use. After speaking with some friends, they gave me the idea of looking up movies and finding theaters near you and displaying some show times. I built the docker workflow and have begun integrating apis.\nWork Time: 3hrs (mostly brainstorming)\nDiscovery\nI cannot find an api to display show times without charging me money.\nDay 1\nImplemented my own custom hook to handle form validation and submission. Check out the note above for ""Forms."" Implemented react redux and now have the \'search result\' updating properly. Fixed a whole bunch of issues with form validation as well as handling strange responses from the OMDB api. I opted to use redux\'s subscribe method to have search result update instead of connect.\nWork Time: 3hrs\nDay 2\nI fixed up a few warnings related to the version of node and switched to node 12.14.0. I also implemented form sanitizing which is composeable. I have also still not been able to find a free movie showtime API and therefore will be faking it. I will be using google\'s geolocation and places search.\nSo after fighting google\'s cors policy for like 2 hours, I finally found a work around. I am essentially routing the request to a website with cors and SSL and all that stuff enabled already which then sends the request to google. I\'m not super familiar with cors so this was the fastest way for me to do it. Without standing up a website. The problem that has arisen is that when you do not pass a location, google\'s places api will use the IP of the requestor. This means that since the rerouter website is located in VA that it will then only search for theaters in that region. This can be overridden by submitting a zip code, but it is just annoying at the moment.\nBecause the react side is very simple, I am only going to be adding tests to the dangerous parts.\nWork Time: 5-6 hours\nPost Mortem\nWell that was a journey and I had a ton of fun writing it. I learned way more about redux throughout this process as well. Some of the major parts that I struggled with was finding open API\'s that would give me the data that I wanted. I think it\'s pretty insane that I couldn\'t find a single free api that would give me show times for movies. On a technical level, I tried to keep the application as simple and lightweight as possible in order to focus on exploring new ways of solving problems.\nHow would I improve this\nI would for sure rework how external requests are made. Right now, all requests go through the request_service.js. This was a great idea when I first started as it collected all of the complicated parts into one spot. It also helped me isolate the weirdness into a single file. The problem is that it soon started evolving into a hectic file. It was getting hard to follow, but after a refactor I think it ended up becomming more workable. I would probably split this file into multiple subdirectories depending on the api that was being used. Then you could really chop it up into single method calls. I would also have spent much more time researching ideas, but after like 3 weeks of this I figured that this one was the best one I could come up with. There will always be some more UI work that can go on, like implementing loading spinners and stuff like that, but I think overall, I the workflow is pretty tight.\nAdding a backend to handle all the external stuff would be amazing too instead of just relying on a client side application.\nWhat went well\nI think that the overall workflow of my application ended up pretty well. I handle a ton of errors and edge cases discovered by testing and trial and error. For example, sometimes the OMDB will just not respond with anything useful and it was by chance that I discovered that. I also liked how I was able to pick up and migrate UI frameworks as well as shift APIs. I had originally wanted to use Fandango for everything, but unfortunately they wanted thousands of dollars. I think my solution is a good work around for not having access to any show times api. I also am pretty happy because this was the first time i\'d ever used Jest as a testing framework. I think I picked it up but there is still a bunch I don\'t know. One thing I\'m super proud of is creating my own custom hook, albeit using a guide, but the fact that I didn\'t use any form library is pretty cool.\nThings I had to scrap\nThe main thing that went wrong was the fact that I couldn\'t get a show times api. The second major thing is I wanted to implement a search history workflow, where it saves a term, movie and more. The problem I saw was that it started to take away from the main question trying to be answered by the premise, build an SPA that you do some meaningful action.\nThanks again for considering me as a candidate for your company and I am super excited to hear back from you.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/bahodge', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Aug 2, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 27, 2020', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated Nov 22, 2020', '6', 'Java', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['FRC-2020\nCode for the 2020 FIRST Robotics Competition!\nGit explained\nThe ""Pro Git"" book is an excellent piece of free documentation for Git.

Remember that word, hash: git hashes a lot of things.\nSo, a tree is the directory structure: think of it as a tree, whose base is the root direction (get it, root?), and the branches are subdirectories, with the leaves being blobs (files).  Now, remember how I said that git tracks objects by their hashes?  Well, what that means is that if a file is unchanged, git will not store another copy: rather, git will just reference the previous copy.\n(It\'s worth noting that just doing that is inefficient: after all, changing one character in a large file will drastically change the hash, and so the large file would be stored all over again.  Git has a quite clever way of packing those together: it\'s called packing, and it\'s what is going on whenever git talks about deltas)\nNow, the next up in the hierarchy of git objects is the commit.  A commit contains a pointer to a tree, but it also states what commit it is based on, who committed it and when, and a custom message that they would have added.  Commits are what you work with a lot in git: while trees and blobs are good to know about, because they are how git works, it\'s important to understand commits first.  However, the author is getting tired, and so they won\'t go further.\nTODO: expand on the above, and explain branches and such\nGit Branch Structure\nThis git repository is designed to allow us to track the various states of confidence\nthat we have in code with more fidelity than simply ""completed"" and ""in progress"".\nLast year, we discovered that the code in our master branch was nonfunctional: we thus\ndid all of our development in a second branch, HartfordCode, leaving master as a\nuseless relic.\nThus, I am introducing a new system of branching, with three main branches, and all\ndevelopment taking place in sub-branches.  We attempted to do development in sub-branches\nlast year, however, this year, we will do this slightly differently.  The main branches are\nas follows: (totally not based on the three-releases model of Debian)\n\'Stable\' branch\nThe Stable branch is the most stable of the branches: it is only for code that has been\nboth thoroughly tested and documented, and can be considered ""competition ready"".  It\nmust not be directly committed to, except in cases of vital bugfixes: instead, bring\nin changes from \'master\'.  Stable is intentionally distinct from master; Code\nin master should be tested and stable, but code in stable should be extremely tested\nand very stable.  Additionally, release tags should be made on stable branch heads.\n\'Master\' branch\nMaster branch is just a typical master branch (it happens to be the equivalent of Debian\ntesting).  Thus, it is code that can be loaded on to the robot before a competition and\nexpected to run.  Commits directly to master are permitted, but only if they are tested\n(eg, bugfixes made during a testing session), and are not recommended (you should make the\nfixes before code enters master).  The master branch can only be set to commits that are\nknown to work: period.  If master is being updated to a less-well-tested version, it is\nrecommended to update stable to point to where master was.  If the code currently in stable\nis still desired, a release tag should be used.\n\'Sid\' branch\nSid is based on the debian branch of the same name.  It is where code suitable  for being\ntested is put.  Code in sid may be buggy: it should not be used for a competition.\nSid may be directly committed to as part of a bugfixes, but commits to sid should\ntry to leave sid in a state that is somewhat suitable for a competition bot.  Thus,\nnew features should be developed in separate branches, and then transferred over to sid.\nGit submodules\nWe use(d) a git submodule to bring in Witchcraft, our reusable set of java classes.  I\'ll\nwrite more on that later: currently, I need to wrap up kickoff day preparations.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/FRC999', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Aug 2, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 27, 2020', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated Nov 22, 2020', '6', 'Java', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['2020-Code is a repository which contains the code for FRC Team 4904’s 2020 Competition Robot.\nTo download this repository, go to terminal, cd into the directory you want to clone into, and type\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/RoboticsTeam4904/2020-Code.git\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/RoboticsTeam4904', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Aug 2, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 27, 2020', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated Nov 22, 2020', '6', 'Java', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020']}"

Johnny-Five programs can be written for Arduino (all models), Electric Imp, Beagle Bone, Intel Galileo & Edison, Linino One, Pinoccio, pcDuino3, Raspberry Pi, Particle/Spark Core & Photon, Tessel 2, TI Launchpad and more!\nJohnny-Five has grown from a passion project into a tool for inspiring learning and creativity for people of all ages, backgrounds, and from all across the world.\nJust interested in learning and building awesome things? You might want to start with the official Johnny-Five website. The website combines content from this repo, the wiki, tutorials from the Bocoup blog and several third-party websites into a single, easily-discoverable source:\n\nIf you want to find the API documentation, that’s right here.\nNeed to figure out what platform to use for a project? We put that stuff here.\nNeed inspiration for your next NodeBot? Check out the examples.\nWant to stay up-to-date with projects in the community? Check this out.\nNeed NodeBots community or Johnny-Five project updates and announcements? This is what you’re looking for.\n\nJohnny-Five does not attempt to provide ""all the things"", but instead focuses on delivering robust, reality tested, highly composable APIs that behave consistently across all supported hardware platforms. Johnny-Five wants to be a baseline control kit for hardware projects, allowing you the freedom to build, grow and experiment with diverse JavaScript libraries of your own choice. Johnny-Five couples comfortably with:\n\nPopular application libraries such as Express.js and Socket.io.\nFellow hardware projects like ar-drone, Aerogel and Spheron\nBluetooth game controllers like XBox Controller and DualShock\nIoT frameworks, such as Octoblu\n\n...And that\'s only a few of the many explorable possibilities. Check out these exciting projects: node-pulsesensor, footballbot-workshop-ui, nodebotui, dublin-disco, node-slot-car-bot, servo-calibrator, node-ardx, nodebot-workshop, phone-home, purple-unicorn, webduino, leapduino, lasercat-workshop, simplesense, five-redbot, robotnik, the-blender\nWhy JavaScript?\nNodeBots: The Rise of JavaScript Robotics\nHello Johnny\nThe ubiquitous ""Hello World"" program of the microcontroller and SoC world is ""blink an LED"". The following code demonstrates how this is done using the Johnny-Five framework.\nvar five = require(""johnny-five"");\nvar board = new five.Board();\n\nboard.on(""ready"", function() {\n  // Create an Led on pin 13\n  var led = new five.Led(13);\n  // Blink every half second\n  led.blink(500);\n});\n\n\nNote: Node will crash if you try to run johnny-five in the node REPL, but board instances will create their own contextual REPL. Put your script in a file.\n\nSupported Hardware\nJohnny-Five has been tested on a variety of Arduino-compatible Boards.\nFor non-Arduino based projects, a number of platform-specific IO Plugins are available. IO Plugins allow Johnny-Five code to communicate with any non-Arduino based hardware in whatever language that platforms speaks!\nDocumentation\nDocumentation for the Johnny-Five API can be found here and example programs here.\nGuidance\nNeed help? Ask a question on the NodeBots Community Forum. If you just have a quick question or are interested in ongoing design discussions, join us in the Johnny-Five Gitter Chat.\nFor step-by-step examples, including an electronics primer, check out Arduino Experimenter\'s Guide for NodeJS by @AnnaGerber\nHere is a list of prerequisites for Linux, OSX or Windows.\nCheck out the bluetooth guide if you want to remotely control your robot.\nSetup and Assemble Arduino\n\nRecommended Starting Kit: Sparkfun Inventor\'s Kit\nDownload Arduino IDE\nPlug in your Arduino or Arduino compatible microcontroller via USB\nOpen the Arduino IDE, select: File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmataPlus\n\nStandardFirmataPlus is available in Firmata v2.5.0 or greater\n\n\nClick the ""Upload"" button.\n\nIf the upload was successful, the board is now prepared and you can close the Arduino IDE.\nFor non-Arduino projects, each IO Plugin\'s repo will provide its own platform specific setup instructions.\nHey you, here\'s Johnny!\nSource Code:\ngit clone git://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five.git && cd johnny-five\n\nnpm install\nnpm package:\nInstall the module with:\nnpm install johnny-five\nExample Programs\nTo get you up and running quickly, we provide a variety of examples for using each Johnny-Five component. One thing we’re especially excited about is the extensive collection of Fritzing diagrams you’ll find throughout the site. A huge part of doing any Johnny-Five project is handling the actual hardware, and we’ve included these as part of the documentation because we realised that instructions on how to write code to control a servo are insufficient without instructions on how to connect a servo!\nTo interactively navigate the examples, visit the Johnny-Five examples page on the official website. If you want to link directly to the examples in this repo, you can use one of the following links.\nThere are presently 365 example programs with code and diagrams!\nBoard\n\nBoard - Basic Initialization\nBoard -

Teams who are competing in the SKYSTONE Challenge should use this new SKYSTONE repository instead of the older (and no longer updated) ftc_app repository.\nWelcome!\nThis GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a FIRST Tech Challenge competition robot.  To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.\nGetting Started\nIf you are new to robotics or new to the FIRST Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the FTC Blocks Tutorial to get familiar with how to use the control system:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0FTC Blocks Online Tutorial\nEven if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the FTC Blocks tutorial, and then migrate to the OnBot Java Tool or to Android Studio afterwards.\nDownloading the Project\nIf you are an Android Studio programmer, there are several ways to download this repo.  Note that if you use the Blocks or OnBot Java Tool to program your robot, then you do not need to download this repository.\n\nIf you are a git user, you can clone the most current version of the repository:\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0git clone https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE.git\n\n\nOr, if you prefer, you can use the ""Download Zip"" button available through the main repository page.  Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.\n\n\nYou can also download the project folder (as a .zip or .tar.gz archive file) from the Downloads subsection of the Releases page for this repository.\n\n\nOnce you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder  (""Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)"").\nGetting Help\nUser Documentation and Tutorials\nFIRST maintains online documentation with information and tutorials on how to use the FIRST Tech Challenge software and robot control system.  You can access this documentation using the following link:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0SKYSTONE Online Documentation\nNote that the online documentation is an ""evergreen"" document that is constantly being updated and edited.  It contains the most current information about the FIRST Tech Challenge software and control system.\nJavadoc Reference Material\nThe Javadoc reference documentation for the FTC SDK is now available online.  Click on the following link to view the FTC SDK Javadoc documentation as a live website:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0FTC Javadoc Documentation\nDocumentation for the FTC SDK is also included with this repository.  There is a subfolder called ""doc"" which contains several subfolders:\n\nThe folder ""apk"" contains the .apk files for the FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps.\nThe folder ""javadoc"" contains the JavaDoc user documentation for the FTC SDK.\n\nOnline User Forum\nFor technical questions regarding the Control System or the FTC SDK, please visit the FTC Technology forum:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0FTC Technology Forum\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.4 (20200108-101156)\n\nFixes SkyStone issue #88\nAdds an inspection item that notes when a robot controller (Control Hub) is using the factory default password.\nFixes SkyStone issue #61\nFixes SkyStone issue #142\nFixes ftc_app issue #417 by adding more current and voltage monitoring capabilities for REV Hubs.\nFixes a crash sometimes caused by OnBotJava activity\nImproves OnBotJava autosave functionality ftc_app #738\nFixes system responsiveness issue when an Expansion Hub is disconnected\nFixes issue where IMU initialization could prevent Op Modes from stopping\nFixes issue where AndroidTextToSpeech.speak() would fail if it was called too early\nAdds telemetry.speak() methods and blocks, which cause the Driver Station (if also updated) to speak text\nAdds and improves Expansion Hub-related warnings\n\nImproves Expansion Hub low battery warning\n\nDisplays the warning immediately after the hub reports it\nSpecifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run\nDisplays which hubs reported low battery\n\n\nDisplays warning when hub loses and regains power during an OpMode run\n\nFixes the hub\'s LED pattern after this condition\n\n\nDisplays warning when Expansion Hub is not responding to commands\n\nSpecifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run\n\n\nClarifies warning when Expansion Hub is not present at startup\n\nSpecifies that this condition requires a Robot Restart before the hub can be used.\nThe hub light will now accurately reflect this state\n\n\nImproves logging and reduces log spam during these conditions\n\n\nSyncs the Control Hub time and timezone to a connected web browser programming the robot, if a Driver Station is not available.\nAdds bulk read functionality for REV Hubs\n\nA bulk caching mode must be set at the Hub level with LynxModule#setBulkCachingMode(). This applies to all relevant SDK hardware classes that reference that Hub.\nThe following following Hub bulk caching modes are available:\n\nBulkCachingMode.OFF (default): All hardware calls operate as usual. Bulk data can read through LynxModule#getBulkData() and processed manually.\nBulkCachingMode.AUTO: Applicable hardware calls are served from a bulk read cache that is cleared/refreshed automatically to ensure identical commands don\'t hit the same cache. The cache can also be cleared manually with LynxModule#clearBulkCache(), although this is not recommended.\n(advanced users) BulkCachingMode.MANUAL: Same as BulkCachingMode.AUTO except the cache is never cleared automatically. To avoid getting stale data, the cache must be manually cleared at the beginning of each loop body or as the user deems appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nRemoves PIDF Annotation values added in Rev 5.3 (to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations).\n\nThe new motor types will still be available but their Default control behavior will revert back to Rev 5.2\n\n\nAdds new ConceptMotorBulkRead sample Opmode to demonstrate and compare Motor Bulk-Read modes for reducing I/O latencies.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.3 (20191004-112306)\n\nFixes external USB/UVC webcam support\nMakes various bugfixes and improvements to Blocks page, including but not limited to:\n\nMany visual tweaks\nBrowser zoom and window resize behave better\nResizing the Java preview pane works better and more consistently across browsers\nThe Java preview pane consistently gets scrollbars when needed\nThe Java preview pane is hidden by default on phones\nInternet Explorer 11 should work\nLarge dropdown lists display properly on lower res screens\nDisabled buttons are now visually identifiable as disabled\nA warning is shown if a user selects a TFOD sample, but their device is not compatible\nWarning messages in a Blocks op mode are now visible by default.\n\n\nAdds goBILDA 5201 and 5202 motors to Robot Configurator\nAdds PIDF Annotation values to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations.\nThis has the effect of causing the RUN_USING_ENCODERS and RUN_TO_POSITION modes to use\nPIDF vs PID closed loop control on these motors.  This should provide more responsive, yet stable, speed control.\nPIDF adds Feedforward control to the basic PID control loop.\nFeedforward is useful when controlling a motor\'s speed because it ""anticipates"" how much the control voltage\nmust change to achieve a new speed set-point, rather than requiring the integrated error to change sufficiently.\nThe PIDF values were chosen to provide responsive, yet stable, speed control on a lightly loaded motor.\nThe more heavily a motor is loaded (drag or friction), the more noticable the PIDF improvement will be.\nFixes startup crash on Android 10\nFixes ftc_app issue #712 (thanks to FROGbots-4634)\nFixes ftc_app issue #542\nAllows ""A"" and lowercase letters when naming device through RC and DS apps.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.2 (20190905-083277)\n\nFixes extra-wide margins on settings activities, and placement of the new configuration button\nAdds Skystone Vuforia image target data.\n\nIncludes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Java).\nIncludes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Blocks).\n\n\nAdds TensorFlow inference model (.tflite) for Skystone game elements.\n\nIncludes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Java).\nIncludes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Blocks).\n\n\nRemoves older (season-specific) sample op modes.\nIncludes 64-bit support (to comply with Google Play requirements).\nProtects against Stuck OpModes when a Restart Robot is requested.

This feature is automatically enabled when using Vuforia or TFOD—no additional RC configuration is required for typical use cases. To hide the stream, select the same menu item again.\nNote that gamepads are disabled and the selected opmode cannot be started while the stream is open as a safety precaution.\nTo use custom streams, consult the API docs for CameraStreamServer#setSource and CameraStreamSource.\n\n\nAdds many Star Wars sounds to RobotController resources.\nAdded SKYSTONE Sounds Chooser Sample Program.\nSwitches out startup, connect chimes, and error/warning sounds for Star Wars sounds\nUpdates OnBot Java to use a WebSocket for communication with the robot\n\nThe OnBot Java page no longer has to do a full refresh when a user switches from editing one file to another\n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nCamera Stream\n\nThe Vuforia camera stream inherits the issues present in the phone preview (namely ftc_app issue #574). This problem does not affect the TFOD camera stream even though it receives frames from Vuforia.\nThe orientation of the stream frames may not always match the phone preview. For now, these frames may be rotated manually via a custom CameraStreamSource if desired.\n\n\nOnBotJava\n\nBrowser back button may not always work correctly\nIt\'s possible for a build to be queued, but not started. The OnBot Java build console will display a warning if this occurs.\nA user might not realize they are editing a different file if the user inadvertently switches from one file to another since this switch is now seamless. The name of the currently open file is displayed in the browser tab.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 5.0 (built on 19.06.14)\n\nSupport for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\nAdds a Java preview pane to the Blocks editor.\nAdds a new offline export feature to the Blocks editor.\nDisplay wifi channel in Network circle on Driver Station.\nAdds calibration for Logitech C270\nUpdates build tooling and target SDK.\nCompliance with Google\'s permissions infrastructure (Required after build tooling update).\nKeep Alives to mitigate the Motorola wifi scanning problem.

4.3 (built on 18.10.31)\n\nIncludes missing TensorFlow-related libraries and files.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.2 (built on 18.10.30)\n\nIncludes fix to avoid deadlock situation with WatchdogMonitor which could result in USB communication errors.\n\nComm error appeared to require that user disconnect USB cable and restart the Robot Controller app to recover.\nrobotControllerLog.txt would have error messages that included the words ""E RobotCore: lynx xmit lock: #### abandoning lock:""\n\n\nIncludes fix to correctly list the parent module address for a REV Robotics Expansion Hub in a configuration (.xml) file.\n\nBug in versions 4.0 and 4.1 would incorrect list the address module for a parent REV Robotics device as ""1"".\nIf the parent module had a higher address value than the daisy-chained module, then this bug would prevent the Robot Controller from communicating with the downstream Expansion Hub.\n\n\nAdded requirement for ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION to allow a Driver Station running Android Oreo to scan for Wi-Fi Direct devices.\nAdded google() repo to build.gradle because aapt2 must be downloaded from the google() repository beginning with version 3.2 of the Android Gradle Plugin.\n\nImportant Note: Android Studio users will need to be connected to the Internet the first time build the ftc_app project.\nInternet connectivity is required for the first build so the appropriate files can be downloaded from the Google repository.\nUsers should not need to be connected to the Internet for subsequent builds.\nThis should also fix buid issue where Android Studio would complain that it ""Could not find com.android.tools.lint:lint-gradle:26.1.4"" (or similar).\n\n\nAdded support for REV Spark Mini motor controller as part of the configuration menu for a servo/PWM port on the REV Expansion Hub.\nProvide examples for playing audio files in an Op Mode.\nBlock Development Tool Changes\n\nIncludes a fix for a problem with the Velocity blocks that were reported in the FTC Technology forum (Blocks Programming subforum).\nChange the ""Save completed successfully."" message to a white color so it will contrast with a green background.\nFixed the ""Download image"" feature so it will work if there are text blocks in the op mode.\n\n\nIntroduce support for Google\'s TensorFlow Lite technology for object detetion for 2018-2019 game.\n\nTensorFlow lite can recognize Gold Mineral and Silver Mineral from 2018-2019 game.\nExample Java and Block op modes are included to show how to determine the relative position of the gold block (left, center, right).\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.1 (released on 18.09.24)\nChanges include:\n\nFix to prevent crash when deprecated configuration annotations are used.\nChange to allow FTC Robot Controller APK to be auto-updated using FIRST Global Control Hub update scripts.\nRemoved samples for non supported / non legal hardware.\nImprovements to Telemetry.addData block with ""text"" socket.\nUpdated Blocks sample op mode list to include Rover Ruckus Vuforia example.\nUpdate SDK library version number.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.0 (released on 18.09.12)\nChanges include:\n\n\nInitial support for UVC compatible cameras\n\nIf UVC camera has a unique serial number, RC will detect and enumerate by serial number.\nIf UVC camera lacks a unique serial number, RC will only support one camera of that type connected.\nCalibration settings for a few cameras are included (see TeamCode/src/main/res/xml/teamwebcamcalibrations.xml for details).\nUser can upload calibration files from Program and Manage web interface.\nUVC cameras seem to draw a fair amount of electrical current from the USB bus.\n\nThis does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n\n\n\n\nThis does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.\nFTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.\n\n\nUpdated sample Vuforia Navigation and VuMark Op Modes to demonstrate how to use an internal phone-based camera and an external UVC webcam.\n\n\n\nSupport for improved motor control.\n\nREV Robotics Expansion Hub firmware 1.8 and greater will support a feed forward mechanism for closed loop motor control.\nFTC SDK has been modified to support PIDF coefficients (proportional, integral, derivative, and feed forward).\nFTC Blocks development tool modified to include PIDF programming blocks.\nDeprecated older PID-related methods and variables.\nREV\'s 1.8.x PIDF-related changes provide a more linear and accurate way to control a motor.\n\n\n\nWireless\n\nAdded 5GHz support for wireless channel changing for those devices that support it.\n\nTested with Moto G5 and E4 phones.\n\n\n\n\nAlso tested with other (currently non-approved) phones such as Samsung Galaxy S8.\n\n\n\nImproved Expansion Hub firmware update support in Robot Controller app\n\nChanges to make the system more robust during the firmware update process (when performed through Robot Controller app).\nUser no longer has to disconnect a downstream daisy-chained Expansion Hub when updating an Expansion Hub\'s firmware.\n\nIf user is updating an Expansion Hub\'s firmware through a USB connection, he/she does not have to disconnect RS485 connection to other Expansion Hubs.\n\n\n\n\nThe user still must use a USB connection to update an Expansion Hub\'s firmware.\nThe user cannot update the Expansion Hub firmware for a downstream device that is daisy chained through an RS485 connection.\n\n\nIf an Expansion Hub accidentally gets ""bricked"" the Robot Controller app is now more likely to recognize the Hub when it scans the USB bus.\n\nRobot Controller app should be able to detect an Expansion Hub, even if it accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.\n\n\n\n\nRobot Controller app should be able to install the firmware onto the Hub, even if if accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.\n\n\n\nResiliency\n\nFTC software can detect and enable an FTDI reset feature that is available with REV Robotics v1.8 Expansion Hub firmware and greater.\n\nWhen enabled, the Expansion Hub can detect if it hasn\'t communicated with the Robot Controller over the FTDI (USB) connection.\n\n\n\n\nIf the Hub hasn\'t heard from the Robot Controller in a while, it will reset the FTDI connection.\nThis action helps system recover from some ESD-induced disruptions.\n\n\nVarious fixes to improve reliability of FTC software.\n\n\n\nBlocks\n\nFixed errors with string and list indices in blocks export to java.\nSupport for USB connected UVC webcams.\nRefactored optimized Blocks Vuforia code to support Rover Ruckus image targets.\nAdded programming blocks to support PIDF (proportional, integral, derivative and feed forward) motor control.\nAdded formatting options (under Telemetry and Miscellaneous categories) so user can set how many decimal places to display a numerical value.\nSupport to play audio files (which are uploaded through Blocks web interface) on Driver Station in addition to the Robot Controller.\nFixed bug with Download Image of Blocks feature.\nSupport for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\nSupport for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor.\nAdded support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device).\nAdded blocks for DcMotorEx methods.\n\nThese are enhanced methods that you can use when supported by the motor controller hardware.\n\n\n\n\nThe REV Robotics Expansion Hub supports these enhanced methods.\nEnhanced methods include methods to get/set motor velocity (in encoder pulses per second), get/set PIDF coefficients, etc..\n\n\n\nModest Improvements in Logging\n\nDecrease frequency of battery checker voltage statements.\nRemoved non-FTC related log statements (wherever possible).\nIntroduced a ""Match Logging"" feature.\n\nUnder ""Settings"" a user can enable/disable this feature (it\'s disabled by default).\n\n\n\n\nIf enabled, user provides a ""Match Number"" through the Driver Station user interface (top of the screen).\n\nThe Match Number is used to create a log file specifically with log statements from that particular Op Mode run.\nMatch log files are stored in /sdcard/FIRST/matlogs on the Robot Controller.\nOnce an op mode run is complete, the Match Number is cleared.\nThis is a convenient way to create a separate match log with statements only related to a specific op mode run.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Devices\n\nSupport for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\nSupport for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor.\nAdded configuration option for REV 20:1 HD Hex Motor.\nAdded support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device).\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFixed some errors in the definitions for acceleration and velocity in our javadoc documentation.\nAdded ability to play audio files on Driver Station\nWhen user is configuring an Expansion Hub, the LED on the Expansion Hub will change blink pattern (purple-cyan)  to indicate which Hub is currently being configured.\nRenamed I2cSensorType to I2cDeviceType.\nAdded an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates localization using 2018-2019 (Rover Ruckus presented by QualComm) Vuforia targets.\nAdded an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics 2m Laser Distance Sensor.\nAdded an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\nRe-categorized external Java sample Op Modes to ""TeleOp"" instead of ""Autonomous"".\n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\n\nInitial support for UVC compatible cameras\n\nUVC cameras seem to draw significant amount of current from the USB bus.\n\nThis does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n\n\n\n\nThis does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.\nFTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.\n\n\nThere might be a possible deadlock which causes the RC to become unresponsive when using a UVC webcam with a Nougat Android Robot Controller.\n\n\n\nWireless\n\nWhen user selects a wireless channel, this channel does not necessarily persist if the phone is power cycled.\n\nTech Team is hoping to eventually address this issue in a future release.\n\n\n\n\nIssue has been present since apps were introduced (i.e., it is not new with the v4.0 release).\n\n\nWireless channel is not currently displayed for WiFi Direct connections.\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe blink indication feature that shows which Expansion Hub is currently being configured does not work for a newly created configuration file.\n\nUser has to first save a newly created configuration file and then close and re-edit the file in order for blink indicator to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 3.6 (built on 17.12.18)\nChanges include:\n\nBlocks Changes\n\nUses updated Google Blockly software to allow users to edit their op modes on Apple iOS devices (including iPad and iPhone).\nImprovement in Blocks tool to handle corrupt op mode files.\nAutonomous op modes should no longer get switched back to tele-op after re-opening them to be edited.\nThe system can now detect type mismatches during runtime and alert the user with a message on the Driver Station.\n\n\nUpdated javadoc documentation for setPower() method to reflect correct range of values (-1 to +1).\nModified VuforiaLocalizerImpl to allow for user rendering of frames\n\nAdded a user-overrideable onRenderFrame() method which gets called by the class\'s renderFrame() method.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 3.5 (built on 17.10.30)\nChanges with version 3.5 include:\n\nIntroduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which can occur after the Robot Controller app has been paused and then resumed (for example, when a user temporarily turns off the display of the Robot Controller phone, and then turns the screen back on).\nIntroduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which were previously caused by random peer disconnect events on the Driver Station.\nFixes issue where log files would be closed on pause of the RC or DS, but not re-opened upon resume.\nFixes issue with battery handler (voltage) start/stop race.\nFixes issue where Android Studio generated op modes would disappear from available list in certain situations.\nFixes problem where OnBot Java would not build on REV Robotics Control Hub.\nFixes problem where OnBot Java would not build if the date and time on the Robot Controller device was ""rewound"" (set to an earlier date/time).\nImproved error message on OnBot Java that occurs when renaming a file fails.\nRemoved unneeded resources from android.jar binaries used by OnBot Java to reduce final size of Robot Controller app.\nAdded MR_ANALOG_TOUCH_SENSOR block to Blocks Programming Tool.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 3.4 (built on 17.09.06)\nChanges with version 3.4 include:\n\nAdded telemetry.update() statement for BlankLinearOpMode template.\nRenamed sample Block op modes to be more consistent with Java samples.\nAdded some additional sample Block op modes.\nReworded OnBot Java readme slightly.\n\n\nVersion 3.3 (built on 17.09.04)\nThis version of the software includes improves for the FTC Blocks Programming Tool and the OnBot Java Programming Tool.\nChanges with verion 3.3 include:\n\nAndroid Studio ftc_app project has been updated to use Gradle Plugin 2.3.3.\nAndroid Studio ftc_app project is already using gradle 3.5 distribution.\nRobot Controller log has been renamed to /sdcard/RobotControllerLog.txt (note that this change was actually introduced w/ v3.2).\nImprovements in I2C reliability.\nOptimized I2C read for REV Expansion Hub, with v1.7 firmware or greater.\nUpdated all external/samples (available through OnBot and in Android project folder).\nVuforia\n\nAdded support for VuMarks that will be used for the 2017-2018 season game.\n\n\nBlocks\n\nUpdate to latest Google Blockly release.\nSample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode.\nFixed bug where the blocks would disappear temporarily when mouse button is held down.\nAdded blocks for Range.clip and Range.scale.\nUser can now disable/enable Block op modes.\nFix to prevent occasional Blocks deadlock.\n\n\nOnBot Java\n\nSignificant improvements with autocomplete function for OnBot Java editor.\nSample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode.\nFixes and changes to complete hardware setup feature.\nUpdated (and more useful) onBot welcome message.\n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nAndroid Studio\n\nAfter updating to the new v3.3 Android Studio project folder, if you get error messages indicating ""InvalidVirtualFileAccessException"" then you might need to do a File->Invalidate Caches / Restart to clear the error.\n\n\nOnBot Java\n\nSometimes when you push the build button to build all op modes, the RC returns an error message that the build failed.  If you press the build button a second time, the build typically suceeds.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 3.2 (built on 17.08.02)\nThis version of the software introduces the ""OnBot Java"" Development Tool.  Similar to the FTC Blocks Development Tool, the FTC OnBot Java Development Tool allows a user to create, edit and build op modes dynamically using only a Javascript-enabled web browser.\nThe OnBot Java Development Tool is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is served up by the Robot Controller.  Op modes are created and edited using a Javascript-enabled browser (Google Chromse is recommended).  Op modes are saved on the Robot Controller Android device directly.\nThe OnBot Java Development Tool provides a Java programming environment that does NOT need Android Studio.\nChanges with version 3.2 include:\n\n\nEnhanced web-based development tools\n\nIntroduction of OnBot Java Development Tool.\nWeb-based programming and management features are ""always on"" (user no longer needs to put Robot Controller into programming mode).\nWeb-based management interface (where user can change Robot Controller name and also easily download Robot Controller log file).\nOnBot Java, Blocks and Management features available from web based interface.\n\n\n\nBlocks Programming Development Tool:\n\nChanged ""LynxI2cColorRangeSensor"" block to ""REV Color/range sensor"" block.\nFixed tooltip for ColorSensor.isLightOn block.\nAdded blocks for ColorSensor.getNormalizedColors and LynxI2cColorRangeSensor.getNormalizedColors.\n\n\n\nAdded example op modes for digital touch sensor and REV Robotics Color Distance sensor.\n\n\nUser selectable color themes.\n\n\nIncludes many minor enhancements and fixes (too numerous to list).\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nAuto complete function is incomplete and does not support the following (for now):\n\nAccess via this keyword\nAccess via super keyword\nMembers of the super cloass, not overridden by the class\nAny methods provided in the current class\nInner classes\nCan\'t handle casted objects\nAny objects coming from an parenthetically enclosed expression\n\n\n\n\nVersion 3.10 (built on 17.05.09)\nThis version of the software provides support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub.  This version also includes improvements in the USB communication layer in an effort to enhance system resiliency.  If you were using a 2.x version of the software previously, updating to version 3.1 requires that you also update your Driver Station software in addition to updating the Robot Controller software.\nAlso note that in version 3.10 software, the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods are no longer available (not deprecated, they have been removed from the SDK). Also note that the the new 3.x software incorporates motor profiles that a user can select as he/she configures the robot.\nChanges include:\n\nBlocks changes\n\nAdded VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener.getPose and Vuforia.trackPose blocks.\nAdded optimized blocks support for Vuforia extended tracking.\nAdded atan2 block to the math category.\nAdded useCompetitionFieldTargetLocations parameter to Vuforia.initialize block.  If set to false, the target locations are placed at (0,0,0) with target orientation as specified in https://github.com/gearsincorg/FTCVuforiaDemo/blob/master/Robot_Navigation.java tutorial op mode.\n\n\nIncorporates additional improvements to USB comm layer to improve system resiliency (to recover from a greater number of communication disruptions).\n\n\nAdditional Notes Regarding Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)\nIn addition to the release changes listed below (see section labeled ""Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.013)""), version 3.00 has the following important changes:\n\nVersion 3.00 software uses a new version of the FTC Robocol (robot protocol).  If you upgrade to v3.0 on the Robot Controller and/or Android Studio side, you must also upgrade the Driver Station software to match the new Robocol.\nVersion 3.00 software removes the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods from the DcMotor class.  If you have an op mode that formerly used these methods, you will need to remove the references/calls to these methods.  Instead, v3.0 provides the max speed information through the use of motor profiles that are selected by the user during robot configuration.\nVersion 3.00 software currently does not have a mechanism to disable extra i2c sensors.  We hope to re-introduce this function with a release in the near future.\n\n\nVersion 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)\n*** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***\nThis software is being released as an ""alpha"" version.  Use this version at your own risk!\nThis pre-release software contains SIGNIFICANT changes, including changes to the Wi-Fi Direct pairing mechanism, rewrites of the I2C sensor classes, changes to the USB/FTDI layer, and the introduction of support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub and the REV Robotics color-range-light sensor.  These changes were implemented to improve the reliability and resiliency of the FTC control system.\nPlease note, however, that version 3.00 is considered ""alpha"" code.  This code is being released so that the FIRST community will have an opportunity to test the new REV Expansion Hub electronics module when it becomes available in May.  The developers do not recommend using this code for critical applications (i.e., competition use).\n*** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***\nChanges include:\n\nMajor rework of sensor-related infrastructure.

This is important - we no longer set the motor modes through the motor controller.\nsetMode and getMode were added to the DcMotor class.\nContinuousRotationServo class has been added to the FTC SDK.\nRange.clip() method has been overloaded so it can support this operation for int, short and byte integers.\nSome changes have been made (new methods added) on how a user can access items from the hardware map.\nUsers can now set the zero power behavior for a DC motor so that the motor will brake or float when power is zero.\nPrototype Blockly Programming Mode has been added to FTC Robot Controller.  Users can place the Robot Controller into this mode, and then use a device (such as a laptop) that has a Javascript enabled browser to write Blockly-based Op Modes directly onto the Robot Controller.\nUsers can now configure the robot remotely through the FTC Driver Station app.\nAndroid Studio project supports Android Studio 2.1.x and compile SDK Version 23 (Marshmallow).\nVuforia Computer Vision SDK integrated into FTC SDK.  Users can use sample vision targets to get localization information on a standard FTC field.\nProject structure has been reorganized so that there is now a TeamCode package that users can use to place their local/custom Op Modes into this package.\nInspection function has been integrated into the FTC Robot Controller and Driver Station Apps (Thanks Team HazMat… 9277 & 10650!).\nAudio cues have been incorporated into FTC SDK.\nSwap mechanism added to FTC Robot Controller configuration activity.  For example, if you have two motor controllers on a robot, and you misidentified them in your configuration file, you can use the Swap button to swap the devices within the configuration file (so you do not have to manually re-enter in the configuration info for the two devices).\nFix mechanism added to all user to replace an electronic module easily.  For example, suppose a servo controller dies on your robot. You replace the broken module with a new module, which has a different serial number from the original servo controller.  You can use the Fix button to automatically reconfigure your configuration file to use the serial number of the new module.\nImprovements made to fix resiliency and responsiveness of the system.\nFor LinearOpMode the user now must for a telemetry.update() to update the telemetry data on the driver station.  This update() mechanism ensures that the driver station gets the updated data properly and at the same time.\nThe Auto Configure function of the Robot Controller is now template based.  If there is a commonly used robot configuration, a template can be created so that the Auto Configure mechanism can be used to quickly configure a robot of this type.\nThe logic to detect a runaway op mode (both in the LinearOpMode and OpMode types) and to abort the run, then auto recover has been improved/implemented.\nFix has been incorporated so that Logitech F310 gamepad mappings will be correct for Marshmallow users.\n\n\nRelease 16.07.08\n\nFor the ftc_app project, the gradle files have been modified to support Android Studio 2.1.x.\n\n\nRelease 16.03.30\n\nFor the MIT App Inventor, the design blocks have new icons that better represent the function of each design component.\nSome changes were made to the shutdown logic to ensure the robust shutdown of some of our USB services.\nA change was made to LinearOpMode so as to allow a given instance to be executed more than once, which is required for the App Inventor.\nJavadoc improved/updated.\n\n\nRelease 16.03.09\n\nChanges made to make the FTC SDK synchronous (significant change!)\n\nwaitOneFullHardwareCycle() and waitForNextHardwareCycle() are no longer needed and have been deprecated.\nrunOpMode() (for a LinearOpMode) is now decoupled from the system\'s hardware read/write thread.\nloop() (for an OpMode) is now decoupled from the system\'s hardware read/write thread.\nMethods are synchronous.\nFor example, if you call setMode(DcMotorController.RunMode.RESET_ENCODERS) for a motor, the encoder is guaranteed to be reset when the method call is complete.\nFor legacy module (NXT compatible), user no longer has to toggle between read and write modes when reading from or writing to a legacy device.\n\n\nChanges made to enhance reliability/robustness during ESD event.\nChanges made to make code thread safe.\nDebug keystore added so that user-generated robot controller APKs will all use the same signed key (to avoid conflicts if a team has multiple developer laptops for example).\nFirmware version information for Modern Robotics modules are now logged.\nChanges made to improve USB comm reliability and robustness.\nAdded support for voltage indicator for legacy (NXT-compatible) motor controllers.\nChanges made to provide auto stop capabilities for op modes.\n\nA LinearOpMode class will stop when the statements in runOpMode() are complete.  User does not have to push the stop button on the driver station.\nIf an op mode is stopped by the driver station, but there is a run away/uninterruptible thread persisting, the app will log an error message then force itself to crash to stop the runaway thread.\n\n\nDriver Station UI modified to display lowest measured voltage below current voltage (12V battery).\nDriver Station UI modified to have color background for current voltage (green=good, yellow=caution, red=danger, extremely low voltage).\njavadoc improved (edits and additional classes).\nAdded app build time to About activity for driver station and robot controller apps.\nDisplay local IP addresses on Driver Station About activity.\nAdded I2cDeviceSynchImpl.\nAdded I2cDeviceSync interface.\nAdded seconds() and milliseconds() to ElapsedTime for clarity.\nAdded getCallbackCount() to I2cDevice.\nAdded missing clearI2cPortActionFlag.\nAdded code to create log messages while waiting for LinearOpMode shutdown.\nFix so Wifi Direct Config activity will no longer launch multiple times.\nAdded the ability to specify an alternate i2c address in software for the Modern Robotics gyro.\n\n\nRelease 16.02.09\n\nImproved battery checker feature so that voltage values get refreshed regularly (every 250 msec) on Driver Station (DS) user interface.\nImproved software so that Robot Controller (RC) is much more resilient and “self-healing” to USB disconnects:\n\nIf user attempts to start/restart RC with one or more module missing, it will display a warning but still start up.\nWhen running an op mode, if one or more modules gets disconnected, the RC & DS will display warnings,and robot will keep on working in spite of the missing module(s).\nIf a disconnected module gets physically reconnected the RC will auto detect the module and the user will regain control of the recently connected module.\nWarning messages are more helpful (identifies the type of module that’s missing plus its USB serial number).\n\n\nCode changes to fix the null gamepad reference when users try to reference the gamepads in the init() portion of their op mode.\nNXT light sensor output is now properly scaled.  Note that teams might have to readjust their light threshold values in their op modes.\nOn DS user interface, gamepad icon for a driver will disappear if the matching gamepad is disconnected or if that gamepad gets designated as a different driver.\nRobot Protocol (ROBOCOL) version number info is displayed in About screen on RC and DS apps.\nIncorporated a display filter on pairing screen to filter out devices that don’t use the “-“ format. This filter can be turned off to show all WiFi Direct devices.\nUpdated text in License file.\nFixed formatting error in OpticalDistanceSensor.toString().\nFixed issue on with a blank (“”) device name that would disrupt WiFi Direct Pairing.\nMade a change so that the WiFi info and battery info can be displayed more quickly on the DS upon connecting to RC.\nImproved javadoc generation.\nModified code to make it easier to support language localization in the future.\n\n\nRelease 16.01.04\n\nUpdated compileSdkVersion for apps\nPrevent Wifi from entering power saving mode\nremoved unused import from driver station\nCorrrected ""Dead zone"" joystick code.\nLED.getDeviceName and .getConnectionInfo() return null\napps check for ROBOCOL_VERSION mismatch\nFix for Telemetry also has off-by-one errors in its data string sizing / short size limitations error\nUser telemetry output is sorted.\nadded formatting variants to DbgLog and RobotLog APIs\ncode modified to allow for a long list of op mode names.\nchanges to improve thread safety of RobocolDatagramSocket\nFix for ""missing hardware leaves robot controller disconnected from driver station"" error\nfix for ""fast tapping of Init/Start causes problems"" (toast is now only instantiated on UI thread).\nadded some log statements for thread life cycle.\nmoved gamepad reset logic inside of initActiveOpMode() for robustness\nchanges made to mitigate risk of race conditions on public methods.\nchanges to try and flag when WiFi Direct name contains non-printable characters.\nfix to correct race condition between .run() and .close() in ReadWriteRunnableStandard.\nupdated FTDI driver\nmade ReadWriteRunnableStanard interface public.\nfixed off-by-one errors in Command constructor\nmoved specific hardware implmentations into their own package.\nmoved specific gamepad implemnatations to the hardware library.\nchanged LICENSE file to new BSD version.\nfixed race condition when shutting down Modern Robotics USB devices.\nmethods in the ColorSensor classes have been synchronized.\ncorrected isBusy() status to reflect end of motion.\ncorrected ""back"" button keycode.\nthe notSupported() method of the GyroSensor class was changed to protected (it should not be public).\n\n\nRelease 15.11.04.001\n\nAdded Support for Modern Robotics Gyro.\n\n\nThe GyroSensor class now supports the MR Gyro Sensor.\nUsers can access heading data (about Z axis)\nUsers can also access raw gyro data (X, Y, & Z axes).\nExample MRGyroTest.java op mode included.\n\n\nImproved error messages\n\n\nMore descriptive error messages for exceptions in user code.\n\n\nUpdated DcMotor API\nEnable read mode on new address in setI2cAddress\nFix so that driver station app resets the gamepads when switching op modes.\nUSB-related code changes to make USB comm more responsive and to display more explicit error messages.\n\n\nFix so that USB will recover properly if the USB bus returns garbage data.\nFix USB initializtion race condition.\nBetter error reporting during FTDI open.\nMore explicit messages during USB failures.\nFixed bug so that USB device is closed if event loop teardown method was not called.\n\n\nFixed timer UI issue\nFixed duplicate name UI bug (Legacy Module configuration).\nFixed race condition in EventLoopManager.\nFix to keep references stable when updating gamepad.\nFor legacy Matrix motor/servo controllers removed necessity of appending ""Motor"" and ""Servo"" to controller names.\nUpdated HT color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbLegacyModule class.\nUpdated MR color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbDeviceInterfaceModule class.\nCorrectly handle I2C Address change in all color sensors\nUpdated/cleaned up op modes.\n\n\nUpdated comments in LinearI2cAddressChange.java example op mode.\nReplaced the calls to ""setChannelMode"" with ""setMode"" (to match the new of the DcMotor  method).\nRemoved K9AutoTime.java op mode.\nAdded MRGyroTest.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Gyro Sensor).\nAdded MRRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Color Sensor).\nAdded HTRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use HT legacy color sensor).\nAdded MatrixControllerDemo.java (demonstrates how to use legacy Matrix controller).\n\n\nUpdated javadoc documentation.\nUpdated release .apk files for Robot Controller and Driver Station apps.\n\nT.

Ejecting\nSomething Missing?\n\nUpdating to New Releases\nCreate React App is divided into two packages:\n\ncreate-react-app is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects.\nreact-scripts is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).\n\nYou almost never need to update create-react-app itself: it delegates all the setup to react-scripts.\nWhen you run create-react-app, it always creates the project with the latest version of react-scripts so you’ll get all the new features and improvements in newly created apps automatically.\nTo update an existing project to a new version of react-scripts, open the changelog, find the version you’re currently on (check package.json in this folder if you’re not sure), and apply the migration instructions for the newer versions.\nIn most cases bumping the react-scripts version in package.json and running npm install in this folder should be enough, but it’s good to consult the changelog for potential breaking changes.\nWe commit to keeping the breaking changes minimal so you can upgrade react-scripts painlessly.\nSending Feedback\nWe are always open to your feedback.\nFolder Structure\nAfter creation, your project should look like this:\nmy-app/\n  README.md\n  node_modules/\n  package.json\n  public/\n    index.html\n    favicon.ico\n  src/\n    App.css\n    App.js\n    App.test.js\n    index.css\n    index.js\n    logo.svg\n\nFor the project to build, these files must exist with exact filenames:\n\npublic/index.html is the page template;\nsrc/index.js is the JavaScript entry point.\n\nYou can delete or rename the other files.\nYou may create subdirectories inside src. For faster rebuilds, only files inside src are processed by Webpack.\nYou need to put any JS and CSS files inside src, otherwise Webpack won’t see them.\nOnly files inside public can be used from public/index.html.\nRead instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.\nYou can, however, create more top-level directories.\nThey will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.\nAvailable Scripts\nIn the project directory, you can run:\nnpm start\nRuns the app in the development mode.\nOpen http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.\nThe page will reload if you make edits.\nYou will also see any lint errors in the console.\nnpm test\nLaunches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\nSee the section about running tests for more information.\nnpm run build\nBuilds the app for production to the build folder.\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\nYour app is ready to be deployed!\nSee the section about deployment for more information.\nnpm run eject\nNote: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!\nIf you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.\nYou don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.\nSupported Browsers\nBy default, the generated project uses the latest version of React.\nYou can refer to the React documentation for more information about supported browsers.\nSupported Language Features and Polyfills\nThis project supports a superset of the latest JavaScript standard.\nIn addition to ES6 syntax features, it also supports:\n\nExponentiation Operator (ES2016).\nAsync/await (ES2017).\nObject Rest/Spread Properties (stage 3 proposal).\nDynamic import() (stage 3 proposal)\nClass Fields and Static Properties (part of stage 3 proposal).\nJSX and Flow syntax.\n\nLearn more about different proposal stages.\nWhile we recommend using experimental proposals with some caution, Facebook heavily uses these features in the product code, so we intend to provide codemods if any of these proposals change in the future.\nNote that the project only includes a few ES6 polyfills:\n\nObject.assign() via object-assign.\nPromise via promise.\nfetch() via whatwg-fetch.\n\nIf you use any other ES6+ features that need runtime support (such as Array.from() or Symbol), make sure you are including the appropriate polyfills manually, or that the browsers you are targeting already support them.\nAlso note that using some newer syntax features like for...of or [...nonArrayValue] causes Babel to emit code that depends on ES6 runtime features and might not work without a polyfill. When in doubt, use Babel REPL to see what any specific syntax compiles down to.\nSyntax Highlighting in the Editor\nTo configure the syntax highlighting in your favorite text editor, head to the relevant Babel documentation page and follow the instructions. Some of the most popular editors are covered.\nDisplaying Lint Output in the Editor\n\nNote: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.2.0 and higher.\nIt also only works with npm 3 or higher.\n\nSome editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, provide plugins for ESLint.\nThey are not required for linting. You should see the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. However, if you prefer the lint results to appear right in your editor, there are some extra steps you can do.\nYou would need to install an ESLint plugin for your editor first. Then, add a file called .eslintrc to the project root:\n{\n  ""extends"": ""react-app""\n}\nNow your editor should report the linting warnings.\nNote that even if you edit your .eslintrc file further, these changes will only affect the editor integration. They won’t affect the terminal and in-browser lint output. This is because Create React App intentionally provides a minimal set of rules that find common mistakes.\nIf you want to enforce a coding style for your project, consider using Prettier instead of ESLint style rules.\nDebugging in the Editor\nThis feature is currently only supported by Visual Studio Code and WebStorm.\nVisual Studio Code and WebStorm support debugging out of the box with Create React App. This enables you as a developer to write and debug your React code without leaving the editor, and most importantly it enables you to have a continuous development workflow, where context switching is minimal, as you don’t have to switch between tools.\nVisual Studio Code\nYou would need to have the latest version of VS Code and VS Code Chrome Debugger Extension installed.\nThen add the block below to your launch.json file and put it inside the .vscode folder in your app’s root directory.\n{\n  ""version"": ""0.2.0"",\n  ""configurations"": [{\n    ""name"": ""Chrome"",\n    ""type"": ""chrome"",\n    ""request"": ""launch"",\n    ""url"": ""http://localhost:3000"",\n    ""webRoot"": ""${workspaceRoot}/src"",\n    ""sourceMapPathOverrides"": {\n      ""webpack:///src/*"": ""${webRoot}/*""\n    }\n  }]\n}\n\nNote: the URL may be different if you\'ve made adjustments via the HOST or PORT environment variables.\n\nStart your app by running npm start, and start debugging in VS Code by pressing F5 or by clicking the green debug icon. You can now write code, set breakpoints, make changes to the code, and debug your newly modified code—all from your editor.\nHaving problems with VS Code Debugging? Please see their troubleshooting guide.\nWebStorm\nYou would need to have WebStorm and JetBrains IDE Support Chrome extension installed.\nIn the WebStorm menu Run select Edit Configurations.... Then click + and select JavaScript Debug. Paste http://localhost:3000 into the URL field and save the configuration.\n\nNote: the URL may be different if you\'ve made adjustments via the HOST or PORT environment variables.\n\nStart your app by running npm start, then press ^D on macOS or F9 on Windows and Linux or click the green debug icon to start debugging in WebStorm.\nThe same way you can debug your application in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PhpStorm, PyCharm Pro, and RubyMine.\nFormatting Code Automatically\nPrettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for JavaScript, CSS and JSON. With Prettier you can format the code you write automatically to ensure a code style within your project. See the Prettier\'s GitHub page for more information, and look at this page to see it in action.\nTo format our code whenever we make a commit in git, we need to install the following dependencies:\nnpm install --save husky lint-staged prettier\nAlternatively you may use yarn:\nyarn add husky lint-staged prettier\n\nhusky makes it easy to use githooks as if they are npm scripts.\nlint-staged allows us to run scripts on staged files in git. See this blog post about lint-staged to learn more about it.\nprettier is the JavaScript formatter we will run before commits.\n\nNow we can make sure every file is formatted correctly by adding a few lines to the package.json in the project root.\nAdd the following line to scripts section:\n  ""scripts"": {\n+   ""precommit"": ""lint-staged"",\n    ""start"": ""react-scripts start"",\n    ""build"": ""react-scripts build"",\nNext we add a \'lint-staged\' field to the package.json, for example:\n  ""dependencies"": {\n    // ...\n  },\n+ ""lint-staged"": {\n+   ""src/**/*.{js,jsx,json,css}"": [\n+     ""prettier --single-quote --write"",\n+     ""git add""\n+   ]\n+ },\n  ""scripts"": {\nNow, whenever you make a commit, Prettier will format the changed files automatically. You can also run ./node_modules/.bin/prettier --single-quote --write ""src/**/*.{js,jsx,json,css}"" to format your entire project for the first time.\nNext you might want to integrate Prettier in your favorite editor. Read the section on Editor Integration on the Prettier GitHub page.\nChanging the Page <title>\nYou can find the source HTML file in the public folder of the generated project. You may edit the <title> tag in it to change the title from “React App” to anything else.\nNote that normally you wouldn’t edit files in the public folder very often. For example, adding a stylesheet is done without touching the HTML.\nIf you need to dynamically update the page title based on the content, you can use the browser document.title API. For more complex scenarios when you want to change the title from React components, you can use React Helmet, a third party library.\nIf you use a custom server for your app in production and want to modify the title before it gets sent to the browser, you can follow advice in this section. Alternatively, you can pre-build each page as a static HTML file which then loads the JavaScript bundle, which is covered here.\nInstalling a Dependency\nThe generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with npm:\nnpm install --save react-router\nAlternatively you may use yarn:\nyarn add react-router\nThis works for any library, not just react-router.\nImporting a Component\nThis project setup supports ES6 modules thanks to Babel.\nWhile you can still use require() and module.exports, we encourage you to use import and export instead.\nFor example:\nButton.js\nimport React, { Component } from \'react\';\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n  render() {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Button; // Don’t forget to use export default!\nDangerButton.js\nimport React, { Component } from \'react\';\nimport Button from \'./Button\'; // Import a component from another file\n\nclass DangerButton extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return <Button color=""red"" />;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default DangerButton;\nBe aware of the difference between default and named exports. It is a common source of mistakes.\nWe suggest that you stick to using default imports and exports when a module only exports a single thing (for example, a component). That’s what you get when you use export default Button and import Button from \'./Button\'.\nNamed exports are useful for utility modules that export several functions. A module may have at most one default export and as many named exports as you like.\nLearn more about ES6 modules:\n\nWhen to use the curly braces?\nExploring ES6: Modules\nUnderstanding ES6: Modules\n\nCode Splitting\nInstead of downloading the entire app before users can use it, code splitting allows you to split your code into small chunks which you can then load on demand.\nThis project setup supports code splitting via dynamic import(). Its proposal is in stage 3. The import() function-like form takes the module name as an argument and returns a Promise which always resolves to the namespace object of the module.\nHere is an example:\nmoduleA.js\nconst moduleA = \'Hello\';\n\nexport { moduleA };\nApp.js\nimport React, { Component } from \'react\';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  handleClick = () => {\n    import(\'./moduleA\')\n      .then(({ moduleA }) => {\n        // Use moduleA\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        // Handle failure\n      });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Load</button>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\nThis will make moduleA.js and all its unique dependencies as a separate chunk that only loads after the user clicks the \'Load\' button.\nYou can also use it with async / await syntax if you prefer it.\nWith React Router\nIf you are using React Router check out this tutorial on how to use code splitting with it. You can find the companion GitHub repository here.\nAlso check out the Code Splitting section in React documentation.\nAdding a Stylesheet\nThis project setup uses Webpack for handling all assets. Webpack offers a custom way of “extending” the concept of import beyond JavaScript. To express that a JavaScript file depends on a CSS file, you need to import the CSS from the JavaScript file:\nButton.css\n.Button {\n  padding: 20px;\n}\nButton.js\nimport React, { Component } from \'react\';\nimport \'./Button.css\'; // Tell Webpack that Button.js uses these styles\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n  render() {\n    // You can use them as regular CSS styles\n    return <div className=""Button"" />;\n  }\n}\nThis is not required for React but many people find this feature convenient. You can read about the benefits of this approach here. However you should be aware that this makes your code less portable to other build tools and environments than Webpack.\nIn development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified .css file in the build output.\nIf you are concerned about using Webpack-specific semantics, you can put all your CSS right into src/index.css. It would still be imported from src/index.js, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool.\nPost-Processing CSS\nThis project setup minifies your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to it automatically through Autoprefixer so you don’t need to worry about it.\nFor example, this:\n.App {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n  align-items: center;\n}\nbecomes this:\n.App {\n  display: -webkit-box;\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\n  display: flex;\n  -webkit-box-orient: horizontal;\n  -webkit-box-direction: normal;\n      -ms-flex-direction: row;\n          flex-direction: row;\n  -webkit-box-align: center;\n      -ms-flex-align: center;\n          align-items: center;\n}\nIf you need to disable autoprefixing for some reason, follow this section.\nAdding a CSS Preprocessor (Sass, Less etc.)\nGenerally, we recommend that you don’t reuse the same CSS classes across different components. For example, instead of using a .Button CSS class in <AcceptButton> and <RejectButton> components, we recommend creating a <Button> component with its own .Button styles, that both <AcceptButton> and <RejectButton> can render (but not inherit).\nFollowing this rule often makes CSS preprocessors less useful, as features like mixins and nesting are replaced by component composition. You can, however, integrate a CSS preprocessor if you find it valuable. In this walkthrough, we will be using Sass, but you can also use Less, or another alternative.\nFirst, let’s install the command-line interface for Sass:\nnpm install --save node-sass-chokidar\nAlternatively you may use yarn:\nyarn add node-sass-chokidar\nThen in package.json, add the following lines to scripts:\n   ""scripts"": {\n+    ""build-css"": ""node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/"",\n+    ""watch-css"": ""npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive"",\n     ""start"": ""react-scripts start"",\n     ""build"": ""react-scripts build"",\n     ""test"": ""react-scripts test --env=jsdom"",\n\nNote: To use a different preprocessor, replace build-css and watch-css commands according to your preprocessor’s documentation.\n\nNow you can rename src/App.css to src/App.scss and run npm run watch-css. The watcher will find every Sass file in src subdirectories, and create a corresponding CSS file next to it, in our case overwriting src/App.css. Since src/App.js still imports src/App.css, the styles become a part of your application. You can now edit src/App.scss, and src/App.css will be regenerated.\nTo share variables between Sass files, you can use Sass imports. For example, src/App.scss and other component style files could include @import ""./shared.scss""; with variable definitions.\nTo enable importing files without using relative paths, you can add the  --include-path option to the command in package.json.\n""build-css"": ""node-sass-chokidar --include-path ./src --include-path ./node_modules src/ -o src/"",\n""watch-css"": ""npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar --include-path ./src --include-path ./node_modules src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive"",\n\nThis will allow you to do imports like\n@import \'styles/_colors.scss\'; // assuming a styles directory under src/\n@import \'nprogress/nprogress\'; // importing a css file from the nprogress node module\nAt this point you might want to remove all CSS files from the source control, and add src/**/*.css to your .gitignore file. It is generally a good practice to keep the build products outside of the source control.\nAs a final step, you may find it convenient to run watch-css automatically with npm start, and run build-css as a part of npm run build. You can use the && operator to execute two scripts sequentially. However, there is no cross-platform way to run two scripts in parallel, so we will install a package for this:\nnpm install --save npm-run-all\nAlternatively you may use yarn:\nyarn add npm-run-all\nThen we can change start and build scripts to include the CSS preprocessor commands:\n   ""scripts"": {\n     ""build-css"": ""node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/"",\n     ""watch-css"": ""npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive"",\n-    ""start"": ""react-scripts start"",\n-    ""build"": ""react-scripts build"",\n+    ""start-js"": ""react-scripts start"",\n+    ""start"": ""npm-run-all -p watch-css start-js"",\n+    ""build-js"": ""react-scripts build"",\n+    ""build"": ""npm-run-all build-css build-js"",\n     ""test"": ""react-scripts test --env=jsdom"",\n     ""eject"": ""react-scripts eject""\n   }\nNow running npm start and npm run build also builds Sass files.\nWhy node-sass-chokidar?\nnode-sass has been reported as having the following issues:\n\n\nnode-sass --watch has been reported to have performance issues in certain conditions when used in a virtual machine or with docker.\n\n\nInfinite styles compiling #1939\n\n\nnode-sass has been reported as having issues with detecting new files in a directory #1891\n\n\nnode-sass-chokidar is used here as it addresses these issues.\nAdding Images, Fonts, and Files\nWith Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.\nYou can import a file right in a JavaScript module. This tells Webpack to include that file in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing a file gives you a string value. This value is the final path you can reference in your code, e.g. as the src attribute of an image or the href of a link to a PDF.\nTo reduce the number of requests to the server, importing images that are less than 10,000 bytes returns a data URI instead of a path. This applies to the following file extensions: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, and png. SVG files are excluded due to #1153.\nHere is an example:\nimport React from \'react\';\nimport logo from \'./logo.png\'; // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image\n\nconsole.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png\n\nfunction Header() {\n  // Import result is the URL of your image\n  return <img src={logo} alt=""Logo"" />;\n}\n\nexport default Header;\nThis ensures that when the project is built, Webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.\nThis works in CSS too:\n.Logo {\n  background-image: url(./logo.png);\n}\nWebpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with ./) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by Webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, Webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.\nPlease be advised that this is also a custom feature of Webpack.\nIt is not required for React but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).\nAn alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.\nUsing the public Folder\n\nNote: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.5.0 and higher.\n\nChanging the HTML\nThe public folder contains the HTML file so you can tweak it, for example, to set the page title.\nThe <script> tag with the compiled code will be added to it automatically during the build process.\nAdding Assets Outside of the Module System\nYou can also add other assets to the public folder.\nNote that we normally encourage you to import assets in JavaScript files instead.\nFor example, see the sections on adding a stylesheet and adding images and fonts.\nThis mechanism provides a number of benefits:\n\nScripts and stylesheets get minified and bundled together to avoid extra network requests.\nMissing files cause compilation errors instead of 404 errors for your users.\nResult filenames include content hashes so you don’t need to worry about browsers caching their old versions.\n\nHowever there is an escape hatch that you can use to add an asset outside of the module system.\nIf you put a file into the public folder, it will not be processed by Webpack. Instead it will be copied into the build folder untouched.   To reference assets in the public folder, you need to use a special variable called PUBLIC_URL.\nInside index.html, you can use it like this:\n<link rel=""shortcut icon"" href=""%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico"">\nOnly files inside the public folder will be accessible by %PUBLIC_URL% prefix. If you need to use a file from src or node_modules, you’ll have to copy it there to explicitly specify your intention to make this file a part of the build.\nWhen you run npm run build, Create React App will substitute %PUBLIC_URL% with a correct absolute path so your project works even if you use client-side routing or host it at a non-root URL.\nIn JavaScript code, you can use process.env.PUBLIC_URL for similar purposes:\nrender() {\n  // Note: this is an escape hatch and should be used sparingly!\n  // Normally we recommend using `import` for getting asset URLs\n  // as described in “Adding Images and Fonts” above this section.\n  return <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \'/img/logo.png\'} />;\n}\nKeep in mind the downsides of this approach:\n\nNone of the files in public folder get post-processed or minified.\nMissing files will not be called at compilation time, and will cause 404 errors for your users.\nResult filenames won’t include content hashes so you’ll need to add query arguments or rename them every time they change.\n\nWhen to Use the public Folder\nNormally we recommend importing stylesheets, images, and fonts from JavaScript.\nThe public folder is useful as a workaround for a number of less common cases:\n\nYou need a file with a specific name in the build output, such as manifest.webmanifest.\nYou have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths.\nYou want to include a small script like pace.js outside of the bundled code.\nSome library may be incompatible with Webpack and you have no other option but to include it as a <script> tag.\n\nNote that if you add a <script> that declares global variables, you also need to read the next section on using them.\nUsing Global Variables\nWhen you include a script in the HTML file that defines global variables and try to use one of these variables in the code, the linter will complain because it cannot see the definition of the variable.\nYou can avoid this by reading the global variable explicitly from the window object, for example:\nconst $ = window.$;\nThis makes it obvious you are using a global variable intentionally rather than because of a typo.\nAlternatively, you can force the linter to ignore any line by adding // eslint-disable-line after it.\nAdding Bootstrap\nYou don’t have to use React Bootstrap together with React but it is a popular library for integrating Bootstrap with React apps. If you need it, you can integrate it with Create React App by following these steps:\nInstall React Bootstrap and Bootstrap from npm. React Bootstrap does not include Bootstrap CSS so this needs to be installed as well:\nnpm install --save react-bootstrap bootstrap@3\nAlternatively you may use yarn:\nyarn add react-bootstrap bootstrap@3\nImport Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the beginning of your src/index.js file:\nimport \'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css\';\nimport \'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css\';\n// Put any other imports below so that CSS from your\n// components takes precedence over default styles.\nImport required React Bootstrap components within src/App.js file or your custom component files:\nimport { Navbar, Jumbotron, Button } from \'react-bootstrap\';\nNow you are ready to use the imported React Bootstrap components within your component hierarchy defined in the render method. Here is an example App.js redone using React Bootstrap.\nUsing a Custom Theme\nSometimes you might need to tweak the visual styles of Bootstrap (or equivalent package).\nWe suggest the following approach:\n\nCreate a new package that depends on the package you wish to customize, e.g. Bootstrap.\nAdd the necessary build steps to tweak the theme, and publish your package on npm.\nInstall your own theme npm package as a dependency of your app.\n\nHere is an example of adding a customized Bootstrap that follows these steps.\nAdding Flow\nFlow is a static type checker that helps you write code with fewer bugs. Check out this introduction to using static types in JavaScript if you are new to this concept.\nRecent versions of Flow work with Create React App projects out of the box.\nTo add Flow to a Create React App project, follow these steps:\n\nRun npm install --save flow-bin (or yarn add flow-bin).\nAdd ""flow"": ""flow"" to the scripts section of your package.json.\nRun npm run flow init (or yarn flow init) to create a .flowconfig file in the root directory.\nAdd // @flow to any files you want to type check (for example, to src/App.js).\n\nNow you can run npm run flow (or yarn flow) to check the files for type errors.\nYou can optionally use an IDE like Nuclide for a better integrated experience.\nIn the future we plan to integrate it into Create React App even more closely.\nTo learn more about Flow, check out its documentation.\nAdding a Router\nCreate React App doesn\'t prescribe a specific routing solution, but React Router is the most popular one.\nTo add it, run:\nnpm install --save react-router-dom\nAlternatively you may use yarn:\nyarn add react-router-dom\nTo try it, delete all the code in src/App.js and replace it with any of the examples on its website. The Basic Example is a good place to get started.\nNote that you may need to configure your production server to support client-side routing before deploying your app.\nAdding Custom Environment Variables\n\nNote: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.2.3 and higher.\n\nYour project can consume variables declared in your environment as if they were declared locally in your JS files. By\ndefault you will have NODE_ENV defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with\nREACT_APP_.\nThe environment variables are embedded during the build time. Since Create React App produces a static HTML/CSS/JS bundle, it can’t possibly read them at runtime. To read them at runtime, you would need to load HTML into memory on the server and replace placeholders in runtime, just like described here. Alternatively you can rebuild the app on the server anytime you change them.\n\nNote: You must create custom environment variables beginning with REACT_APP_. Any other variables except NODE_ENV will be ignored to avoid accidentally exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name. Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.\n\nThese environment variables will be defined for you on process.env. For example, having an environment\nvariable named REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE will be exposed in your JS as process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE.\nThere is also a special built-in environment variable called NODE_ENV. You can read it from process.env.NODE_ENV. When you run npm start, it is always equal to \'development\', when you run npm test it is always equal to \'test\', and when you run npm run build to make a production bundle, it is always equal to \'production\'. You cannot override NODE_ENV manually. This prevents developers from accidentally deploying a slow development build to production.\nThese environment variables can be useful for displaying information conditionally based on where the project is\ndeployed or consuming sensitive data that lives outside of version control.\nFirst, you need to have environment variables defined. For example, let’s say you wanted to consume a secret defined\nin the environment inside a <form>:\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <small>You are running this application in <b>{process.env.NODE_ENV}</b> mode.</small>\n      <form>\n        <input type=""hidden"" defaultValue={process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE} />\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nDuring the build, process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE will be replaced with the current value of the REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE environment variable. Remember that the NODE_ENV variable will be set for you automatically.\nWhen you load the app in the browser and inspect the <input>, you will see its value set to abcdef, and the bold text will show the environment provided when using npm start:\n<div>\n  <small>You are running this application in <b>development</b> mode.</small>\n  <form>\n    <input type=""hidden"" value=""abcdef"" />\n  </form>\n</div>\nThe above form is looking for a variable called REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE from the environment. In order to consume this\nvalue, we need to have it defined in the environment. This can be done using two ways: either in your shell or in\na .env file. Both of these ways are described in the next few sections.\nHaving access to the NODE_ENV is also useful for performing actions conditionally:\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \'production\') {\n  analytics.disable();\n}\nWhen you compile the app with npm run build, the minification step will strip out this condition, and the resulting bundle will be smaller.\nReferencing Environment Variables in the HTML\n\nNote: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.9.0 and higher.\n\nYou can also access the environment variables starting with REACT_APP_ in the public/index.html. For example:\n<title>%REACT_APP_WEBSITE_NAME%</title>\nNote that the caveats from the above section apply:\n\nApart from a few built-in variables (NODE_ENV and PUBLIC_URL), variable names must start with REACT_APP_ to work.\nThe environment variables are injected at build time. If you need to inject them at runtime, follow this approach instead.\n\nAdding Temporary Environment Variables In Your Shell\nDefining environment variables can vary between OSes. It’s also important to know that this manner is temporary for the\nlife of the shell session.\nWindows (cmd.exe)\nset ""REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef"" && npm start\n(Note: Quotes around the variable assignment are required to avoid a trailing whitespace.)\nWindows (Powershell)\n($env:REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE = ""abcdef"") -and (npm start)\nLinux, macOS (Bash)\nREACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef npm start\nAdding Development Environment Variables In .env\n\nNote: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.5.0 and higher.\n\nTo define permanent environment variables, create a file called .env in the root of your project:\nREACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef\n\n\nNote: You must create custom environment variables beginning with REACT_APP_. Any other variables except NODE_ENV will be ignored to avoid accidentally exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name. Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.\n\n.env files should be checked into source control (with the exclusion of .env*.local).\nWhat other .env files can be used?\n\nNote: this feature is available with react-scripts@1.0.0 and higher.\n\n\n.env: Default.\n.env.local: Local overrides. This file is loaded for all environments except test.\n.env.development, .env.test, .env.production: Environment-specific settings.\n.env.development.local, .env.test.local, .env.production.local: Local overrides of environment-specific settings.\n\nFiles on the left have more priority than files on the right:\n\nnpm start: .env.development.local, .env.development, .env.local, .env\nnpm run build: .env.production.local, .env.production, .env.local, .env\nnpm test: .env.test.local, .env.test, .env (note .env.local is missing)\n\nThese variables will act as the defaults if the machine does not explicitly set them.\nPlease refer to the dotenv documentation for more details.\n\nNote: If you are defining environment variables for development, your CI and/or hosting platform will most likely need\nthese defined as well. Consult their documentation how to do this. For example, see the documentation for Travis CI or Heroku.\n\nExpanding Environment Variables In .env\n\nNote: this feature is available with react-scripts@1.1.0 and higher.\n\nExpand variables already on your machine for use in your .env file (using dotenv-expand).\nFor example, to get the environment variable npm_package_version:\nREACT_APP_VERSION=$npm_package_version\n# also works:\n# REACT_APP_VERSION=${npm_package_version}\n\nOr expand variables local to the current .env file:\nDOMAIN=www.example.com\nREACT_APP_FOO=$DOMAIN/foo\nREACT_APP_BAR=$DOMAIN/bar\n\nCan I Use Decorators?\nMany popular libraries use decorators in their documentation.\nCreate React App doesn’t support decorator syntax at the moment because:\n\nIt is an experimental proposal and is subject to change.\nThe current specification version is not officially supported by Babel.\nIf the specification changes, we won’t be able to write a codemod because we don’t use them internally at Facebook.\n\nHowever in many cases you can rewrite decorator-based code without decorators just as fine.\nPlease refer to these two threads for reference:\n\n#214\n#411\n\nCreate React App will add decorator support when the specification advances to a stable stage.\nFetching Data with AJAX Requests\nReact doesn\'t prescribe a specific approach to data fetching, but people commonly use either a library like axios or the fetch() API provided by the browser. Conveniently, Create React App includes a polyfill for fetch() so you can use it without worrying about the browser support.\nThe global fetch function allows to easily makes AJAX requests. It takes in a URL as an input and returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object. You can find more information about fetch here.\nThis project also includes a Promise polyfill which provides a full implementation of Promises/A+. A Promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation, you can find more information about Promises here and here. Both axios and fetch() use Promises under the hood. You can also use the async / await syntax to reduce the callback nesting.\nYou can learn more about making AJAX requests from React components in the FAQ entry on the React website.\nIntegrating with an API Backend\nThese tutorials will help you to integrate your app with an API backend running on another port,\nusing fetch() to access it.\nNode\nCheck out this tutorial.\nYou can find the companion GitHub repository here.\nRuby on Rails\nCheck out this tutorial.\nYou can find the companion GitHub repository here.\nProxying API Requests in Development\n\nNote: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.2.3 and higher.\n\nPeople often serve the front-end React app from the same host and port as their backend implementation.\nFor example, a production setup might look like this after the app is deployed:\n/             - static server returns index.html with React app\n/todos        - static server returns index.html with React app\n/api/todos    - server handles any /api/* requests using the backend implementation\n\nSuch setup is not required. However, if you do have a setup like this, it is convenient to write requests like fetch(\'/api/todos\') without worrying about redirecting them to another host or port during development.\nTo tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server in development, add a proxy field to your package.json, for example:\n  ""proxy"": ""http://localhost:4000"",\nThis way, when you fetch(\'/api/todos\') in development, the development server will recognize that it’s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to http://localhost:4000/api/todos as a fallback. The development server will only attempt to send requests without text/html in its Accept header to the proxy.\nConveniently, this avoids CORS issues and error messages like this in development:\nFetch API cannot load http://localhost:4000/api/todos. No \'Access-Control-Allow-Origin\' header is present on the requested resource. Origin \'http://localhost:3000\' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request\'s mode to \'no-cors\' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.\n\nKeep in mind that proxy only has effect in development (with npm start), and it is up to you to ensure that URLs like /api/todos point to the right thing in production. You don’t have to use the /api prefix. Any unrecognized request without a text/html accept header will be redirected to the specified proxy.\nThe proxy option supports HTTP, HTTPS and WebSocket connections.\nIf the proxy option is not flexible enough for you, alternatively you can:\n\nConfigure the proxy yourself\nEnable CORS on your server (here’s how to do it for Express).\nUse environment variables to inject the right server host and port into your app.\n\n""Invalid Host Header"" Errors After Configuring Proxy\nWhen you enable the proxy option, you opt into a more strict set of host checks. This is necessary because leaving the backend open to remote hosts makes your computer vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks. The issue is explained in this article and this issue.\nThis shouldn’t affect you when developing on localhost, but if you develop remotely like described here, you will see this error in the browser after enabling the proxy option:\n\nInvalid Host header\n\nTo work around it, you can specify your public development host in a file called .env.development in the root of your project:\nHOST=mypublicdevhost.com\n\nIf you restart the development server now and load the app from the specified host, it should work.\nIf you are still having issues or if you’re using a more exotic environment like a cloud editor, you can bypass the host check completely by adding a line to .env.development.local. Note that this is dangerous and exposes your machine to remote code execution from malicious websites:\n# NOTE: THIS IS DANGEROUS!\n# It exposes your machine to attacks from the websites you visit.\nDANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true\n\nWe don’t recommend this approach.\nConfiguring the Proxy Manually\n\nNote: this feature is available with react-scripts@1.0.0 and higher.\n\nIf the proxy option is not flexible enough for you, you can specify an object in the following form (in package.json).\nYou may also specify any configuration value http-proxy-middleware or http-proxy supports.\n{\n  // ...\n  ""proxy"": {\n    ""/api"": {\n      ""target"": ""<url>"",\n      ""ws"": true\n      // ...\n    }\n  }\n  // ...\n}\nAll requests matching this path will be proxies, no exceptions. This includes requests for text/html, which the standard proxy option does not proxy.\nIf you need to specify multiple proxies, you may do so by specifying additional entries.\nMatches are regular expressions, so that you can use a regexp to match multiple paths.\n{\n  // ...\n  ""proxy"": {\n    // Matches any request starting with /api\n    ""/api"": {\n      ""target"": ""<url_1>"",\n      ""ws"": true\n      // ...\n    },\n    // Matches any request starting with /foo\n    ""/foo"": {\n      ""target"": ""<url_2>"",\n      ""ssl"": true,\n      ""pathRewrite"": {\n        ""^/foo"": ""/foo/beta""\n      }\n      // ...\n    },\n    // Matches /bar/abc.html but not /bar/sub/def.html\n    ""/bar/[^/]*[.]html"": {\n      ""target"": ""<url_3>"",\n      // ...\n    },\n    // Matches /baz/abc.html and /baz/sub/def.html\n    ""/baz/.*/.*[.]html"": {\n      ""target"": ""<url_4>""\n      // ...\n    }\n  }\n  // ...\n}\nConfiguring a WebSocket Proxy\nWhen setting up a WebSocket proxy, there are a some extra considerations to be aware of.\nIf you’re using a WebSocket engine like Socket.io, you must have a Socket.io server running that you can use as the proxy target. Socket.io will not work with a standard WebSocket server. Specifically, don\'t expect Socket.io to work with the websocket.org echo test.\nThere’s some good documentation available for setting up a Socket.io server.\nStandard WebSockets will work with a standard WebSocket server as well as the websocket.org echo test. You can use libraries like ws for the server, with native WebSockets in the browser.\nEither way, you can proxy WebSocket requests manually in package.json:\n{\n  // ...\n  ""proxy"": {\n    ""/socket"": {\n      // Your compatible WebSocket server\n      ""target"": ""ws://<socket_url>"",\n      // Tell http-proxy-middleware that this is a WebSocket proxy.\n      // Also allows you to proxy WebSocket requests without an additional HTTP request\n      // https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware#external-websocket-upgrade\n      ""ws"": true\n      // ...\n    }\n  }\n  // ...\n}\nUsing HTTPS in Development\n\nNote: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.4.0 and higher.\n\nYou may require the dev server to serve pages over HTTPS. One particular case where this could be useful is when using the ""proxy"" feature to proxy requests to an API server when that API server is itself serving HTTPS.\nTo do this, set the HTTPS environment variable to true, then start the dev server as usual with npm start:\nWindows (cmd.exe)\nset HTTPS=true&&npm start\nWindows (Powershell)\n($env:HTTPS = $true) -and (npm start)\n(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)\nLinux, macOS (Bash)\nHTTPS=true npm start\nNote that the server will use a self-signed certificate, so your web browser will almost definitely display a warning upon accessing the page.\nGenerating Dynamic <meta> Tags on the Server\nSince Create React App doesn’t support server rendering, you might be wondering how to make <meta> tags dynamic and reflect the current URL. To solve this, we recommend to add placeholders into the HTML, like this:\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=""en"">\n  <head>\n    <meta property=""og:title"" content=""__OG_TITLE__"">\n    <meta property=""og:description"" content=""__OG_DESCRIPTION__"">\nThen, on the server, regardless of the backend you use, you can read index.html into memory and replace __OG_TITLE__, __OG_DESCRIPTION__, and any other placeholders with values depending on the current URL. Just make sure to sanitize and escape the interpolated values so that they are safe to embed into HTML!\nIf you use a Node server, you can even share the route matching logic between the client and the server. However duplicating it also works fine in simple cases.\nPre-Rendering into Static HTML Files\nIf you’re hosting your build with a static hosting provider you can use react-snapshot or react-snap to generate HTML pages for each route, or relative link, in your application. These pages will then seamlessly become active, or “hydrated”, when the JavaScript bundle has loaded.\nThere are also opportunities to use this outside of static hosting, to take the pressure off the server when generating and caching routes.\nThe primary benefit of pre-rendering is that you get the core content of each page with the HTML payload—regardless of whether or not your JavaScript bundle successfully downloads. It also increases the likelihood that each route of your application will be picked up by search engines.\nYou can read more about zero-configuration pre-rendering (also called snapshotting) here.\nInjecting Data from the Server into the Page\nSimilarly to the previous section, you can leave some placeholders in the HTML that inject global variables, for example:\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=""en"">\n  <head>\n    <script>\n      window.SERVER_DATA = __SERVER_DATA__;\n    </script>\nThen, on the server, you can replace __SERVER_DATA__ with a JSON of real data right before sending the response. The client code can then read window.SERVER_DATA to use it. Make sure to sanitize the JSON before sending it to the client as it makes your app vulnerable to XSS attacks.\nRunning Tests\n\nNote: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.3.0 and higher.\nRead the migration guide to learn how to enable it in older projects!\n\nCreate React App uses Jest as its test runner. To prepare for this integration, we did a major revamp of Jest so if you heard bad things about it years ago, give it another try.\nJest is a Node-based runner. This means that the tests always run in a Node environment and not in a real browser. This lets us enable fast iteration speed and prevent flakiness.\nWhile Jest provides browser globals such as window thanks to jsdom, they are only approximations of the real browser behavior. Jest is intended to be used for unit tests of your logic and your components rather than the DOM quirks.\nWe recommend that you use a separate tool for browser end-to-end tests if you need them. They are beyond the scope of Create React App.\nFilename Conventions\nJest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions:\n\nFiles with .js suffix in __tests__ folders.\nFiles with .test.js suffix.\nFiles with .spec.js suffix.\n\nThe .test.js / .spec.js files (or the __tests__ folders) can be located at any depth under the src top level folder.\nWe recommend to put the test files (or __tests__ folders) next to the code they are testing so that relative imports appear shorter. For example, if App.test.js and App.js are in the same folder, the test just needs to import App from \'./App\' instead of a long relative path. Colocation also helps find tests more quickly in larger projects.\nCommand Line Interface\nWhen you run npm test, Jest will launch in the watch mode. Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests, just like npm start recompiles the code.\nThe watcher includes an interactive command-line interface with the ability to run all tests, or focus on a search pattern. It is designed this way so that you can keep it open and enjoy fast re-runs. You can learn the commands from the “Watch Usage” note that the watcher prints after every run:\n\nVersion Control Integration\nBy default, when you run npm test, Jest will only run the tests related to files changed since the last commit. This is an optimization designed to make your tests run fast regardless of how many tests you have. However it assumes that you don’t often commit the code that doesn’t pass the tests.\nJest will always explicitly mention that it only ran tests related to the files changed since the last commit. You can also press a in the watch mode to force Jest to run all tests.\nJest will always run all tests on a continuous integration server or if the project is not inside a Git or Mercurial repository.\nWriting Tests\nTo create tests, add it() (or test()) blocks with the name of the test and its code. You may optionally wrap them in describe() blocks for logical grouping but this is neither required nor recommended.\nJest provides a built-in expect() global function for making assertions. A basic test could look like this:\nimport sum from \'./sum\';\n\nit(\'sums numbers\', () => {\n  expect(sum(1, 2)).toEqual(3);\n  expect(sum(2, 2)).toEqual(4);\n});\nAll expect() matchers supported by Jest are extensively documented here.\nYou can also use jest.fn() and expect(fn).toBeCalled() to create “spies” or mock functions.\nTesting Components\nThere is a broad spectrum of component testing techniques. They range from a “smoke test” verifying that a component renders without throwing, to shallow rendering and testing some of the output, to full rendering and testing component lifecycle and state changes.\nDifferent projects choose different testing tradeoffs based on how often components change, and how much logic they contain. If you haven’t decided on a testing strategy yet, we recommend that you start with creating simple smoke tests for your components:\nimport React from \'react\';\nimport ReactDOM from \'react-dom\';\nimport App from \'./App\';\n\nit(\'renders without crashing\', () => {\n  const div = document.createElement(\'div\');\n  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);\n});\nThis test mounts a component and makes sure that it didn’t throw during rendering. Tests like this provide a lot of value with very little effort so they are great as a starting point, and this is the test you will find in src/App.test.js.\nWhen you encounter bugs caused by changing components, you will gain a deeper insight into which parts of them are worth testing in your application. This might be a good time to introduce more specific tests asserting specific expected output or behavior.\nIf you’d like to test components in isolation from the child components they render, we recommend using shallow() rendering API from Enzyme. To install it, run:\nnpm install --save enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer\nAlternatively you may use yarn:\nyarn add enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer\nAs of Enzyme 3, you will need to install Enzyme along with an Adapter corresponding to the version of React you are using. (The examples above use the adapter for React 16.)\nThe adapter will also need to be configured in your global setup file:\nsrc/setupTests.js\nimport { configure } from \'enzyme\';\nimport Adapter from \'enzyme-adapter-react-16\';\n\nconfigure({ adapter: new Adapter() });\n\nNote: Keep in mind that if you decide to ""eject"" before creating src/setupTests.js, the resulting package.json file won\'t contain any reference to it. Read here to learn how to add this after ejecting.\n\nNow you can write a smoke test with it:\nimport React from \'react\';\nimport { shallow } from \'enzyme\';\nimport App from \'./App\';\n\nit(\'renders without crashing\', () => {\n  shallow(<App />);\n});\nUnlike the previous smoke test using ReactDOM.render(), this test only renders <App> and doesn’t go deeper. For example, even if <App> itself renders a <Button> that throws, this test will pass. Shallow rendering is great for isolated unit tests, but you may still want to create some full rendering tests to ensure the components integrate correctly. Enzyme supports full rendering with mount(), and you can also use it for testing state changes and component lifecycle.\nYou can read the Enzyme documentation for more testing techniques. Enzyme documentation uses Chai and Sinon for assertions but you don’t have to use them because Jest provides built-in expect() and jest.fn() for spies.\nHere is an example from Enzyme documentation that asserts specific output, rewritten to use Jest matchers:\nimport React from \'react\';\nimport { shallow } from \'enzyme\';\nimport App from \'./App\';\n\nit(\'renders welcome message\', () => {\n  const wrapper = shallow(<App />);\n  const welcome = <h2>Welcome to React</h2>;\n  // expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).to.equal(true);\n  expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).toEqual(true);\n});\nAll Jest matchers are extensively documented here.\nNevertheless you can use a third-party assertion library like Chai if you want to, as described below.\nAdditionally, you might find jest-enzyme helpful to simplify your tests with readable matchers. The above contains code can be written more simply with jest-enzyme.\nexpect(wrapper).toContainReact(welcome)\nTo enable this, install jest-enzyme:\nnpm install --save jest-enzyme\nAlternatively you may use yarn:\nyarn add jest-enzyme\nImport it in src/setupTests.js to make its matchers available in every test:\nimport \'jest-enzyme\';\nUse react-testing-library\nAs an alternative or companion to enzyme, you may consider using react-testing-library. react-testing-library is a library for testing React components in a way that resembles the way the components are used by end users. It is well suited for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing of React components and applications. It works more directly with DOM nodes, and therefore it\'s recommended to use with jest-dom for improved assertions.\nTo install react-testing-library and jest-dom, you can run:\nnpm install --save react-testing-library jest-dom\nAlternatively you may use yarn:\nyarn add react-testing-library jest-dom\nSimilar to enzyme you can create a src/setupTests.js file to avoid boilerplate in your test files:\n// react-testing-library renders your components to document.body,\n// this will ensure they\'re removed after each test.\nimport \'react-testing-library/cleanup-after-each\';\n\n// this adds jest-dom\'s custom assertions\nimport \'jest-dom/extend-expect\';\nHere\'s an example of using react-testing-library and jest-dom for testing that the <App /> component renders ""Welcome to React"".\nimport React from \'react\';\nimport { render } from \'react-testing-library\';\nimport App from \'./App\';\n\nit(\'renders welcome message\', () => {\n  const { getByText } = render(<App />);\n  expect(getByText(\'Welcome to React\')).toBeInTheDOM();\n});\nLearn more about the utilities provided by react-testing-library to facilitate testing asynchronous interactions as well as selecting form elements from the react-testing-library documentation and examples.\nUsing Third Party Assertion Libraries\nWe recommend that you use expect() for assertions and jest.fn() for spies. If you are having issues with them please file those against Jest, and we’ll fix them. We intend to keep making them better for React, supporting, for example, pretty-printing React elements as JSX.\nHowever, if you are used to other libraries, such as Chai and Sinon, or if you have existing code using them that you’d like to port over, you can import them normally like this:\nimport sinon from \'sinon\';\nimport { expect } from \'chai\';\nand then use them in your tests like you normally do.\nInitializing Test Environment\n\nNote: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.4.0 and higher.\n\nIf your app uses a browser API that you need to mock in your tests or if you just need a global setup before running your tests, add a src/setupTests.js to your project. It will be automatically executed before running your tests.\nFor example:\nsrc/setupTests.js\nconst localStorageMock = {\n  getItem: jest.fn(),\n  setItem: jest.fn(),\n  clear: jest.fn()\n};\nglobal.localStorage = localStorageMock\n\nNote: Keep in mind that if you decide to ""eject"" before creating src/setupTests.js, the resulting package.json file won\'t contain any reference to it, so you should manually create the property setupTestFrameworkScriptFile in the configuration for Jest, something like the following:\n\n\n""jest"": {\n  // ...\n  ""setupTestFrameworkScriptFile"": ""<rootDir>/src/setupTests.js""\n }\n\nFocusing and Excluding Tests\nYou can replace it() with xit() to temporarily exclude a test from being executed.\nSimilarly, fit() lets you focus on a specific test without running any other tests.\nCoverage Reporting\nJest has an integrated coverage reporter that works well with ES6 and requires no configuration.\nRun npm test -- --coverage (note extra -- in the middle) to include a coverage report like this:\n\nNote that tests run much slower with coverage so it is recommended to run it separately from your normal workflow.\nConfiguration\nThe default Jest coverage configuration can be overriden by adding any of the following supported keys to a Jest config in your package.json.\nSupported overrides:\n\ncollectCoverageFrom\ncoverageReporters\ncoverageThreshold\nsnapshotSerializers\n\nExample package.json:\n{\n  ""name"": ""your-package"",\n  ""jest"": {\n    ""collectCoverageFrom"" : [\n      ""src/**/*.{js,jsx}"",\n      ""!<rootDir>/node_modules/"",\n      ""!<rootDir>/path/to/dir/""\n    ],\n    ""coverageThreshold"": {\n      ""global"": {\n        ""branches"": 90,\n        ""functions"": 90,\n        ""lines"": 90,\n        ""statements"": 90\n      }\n    },\n    ""coverageReporters"": [""text""],\n    ""snapshotSerializers"": [""my-serializer-module""]\n  }\n}\nContinuous Integration\nBy default npm test runs the watcher with interactive CLI. However, you can force it to run tests once and finish the process by setting an environment variable called CI.\nWhen creating a build of your application with npm run build linter warnings are not checked by default. Like npm test, you can force the build to perform a linter warning check by setting the environment variable CI. If any warnings are encountered then the build fails.\nPopular CI servers already set the environment variable CI by default but you can do this yourself too:\nOn CI servers\nTravis CI\n\nFollowing the Travis Getting started guide for syncing your GitHub repository with Travis.  You may need to initialize some settings manually in your profile page.\nAdd a .travis.yml file to your git repository.\n\nlanguage: node_js\nnode_js:\n  - 6\ncache:\n  directories:\n    - node_modules\nscript:\n  - npm run build\n  - npm test\n\n\nTrigger your first build with a git push.\nCustomize your Travis CI Build if needed.\n\nCircleCI\nFollow this article to set up CircleCI with a Create React App project.\nOn your own environment\nWindows (cmd.exe)\nset CI=true&&npm test\nset CI=true&&npm run build\n(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)\nWindows (Powershell)\n($env:CI = $true) -and (npm test)\n($env:CI = $true) -and (npm run build)\nLinux, macOS (Bash)\nCI=true npm test\nCI=true npm run build\nThe test command will force Jest to run tests once instead of launching the watcher.\n\nIf you find yourself doing this often in development, please file an issue to tell us about your use case because we want to make watcher the best experience and are open to changing how it works to accommodate more workflows.\n\nThe build command will check for linter warnings and fail if any are found.\nDisabling jsdom\nBy default, the package.json of the generated project looks like this:\n  ""scripts"": {\n    ""start"": ""react-scripts start"",\n    ""build"": ""react-scripts build"",\n    ""test"": ""react-scripts test --env=jsdom""\nIf you know that none of your tests depend on jsdom, you can safely remove --env=jsdom, and your tests will run faster:\n  ""scripts"": {\n    ""start"": ""react-scripts start"",\n    ""build"": ""react-scripts build"",\n-   ""test"": ""react-scripts test --env=jsdom""\n+   ""test"": ""react-scripts test""\nTo help you make up your mind, here is a list of APIs that need jsdom:\n\nAny browser globals like window and document\nReactDOM.render()\nTestUtils.renderIntoDocument() (a shortcut for the above)\nmount() in Enzyme\n\nIn contrast, jsdom is not needed for the following APIs:\n\nTestUtils.createRenderer() (shallow rendering)\nshallow() in Enzyme\n\nFinally, jsdom is also not needed for snapshot testing.\nSnapshot Testing\nSnapshot testing is a feature of Jest that automatically generates text snapshots of your components and saves them on the disk so if the UI output changes, you get notified without manually writing any assertions on the component output. Read more about snapshot testing.\nEditor Integration\nIf you use Visual Studio Code, there is a Jest extension which works with Create React App out of the box. This provides a lot of IDE-like features while using a text editor: showing the status of a test run with potential fail messages inline, starting and stopping the watcher automatically, and offering one-click snapshot updates.\n\nDebugging Tests\nThere are various ways to setup a debugger for your Jest tests. We cover debugging in Chrome and Visual Studio Code.\n\nNote: debugging tests requires Node 8 or higher.\n\nDebugging Tests in Chrome\nAdd the following to the scripts section in your project\'s package.json\n""scripts"": {\n    ""test:debug"": ""react-scripts --inspect-brk test --runInBand --env=jsdom""\n  }\nPlace debugger; statements in any test and run:\n$ npm run test:debug\nThis will start running your Jest tests, but pause before executing to allow a debugger to attach to the process.\nOpen the following in Chrome\nabout:inspect\n\nAfter opening that link, the Chrome Developer Tools will be displayed. Select inspect on your process and a breakpoint will be set at the first line of the react script (this is done simply to give you time to open the developer tools and to prevent Jest from executing before you have time to do so). Click the button that looks like a ""play"" button in the upper right hand side of the screen to continue execution. When Jest executes the test that contains the debugger statement, execution will pause and you can examine the current scope and call stack.\n\nNote: the --runInBand cli option makes sure Jest runs test in the same process rather than spawning processes for individual tests. Normally Jest parallelizes test runs across processes but it is hard to debug many processes at the same time.\n\nDebugging Tests in Visual Studio Code\nDebugging Jest tests is supported out of the box for Visual Studio Code.\nUse the following launch.json configuration file:\n{\n  ""version"": ""0.2.0"",\n  ""configurations"": [\n    {\n      ""name"": ""Debug CRA Tests"",\n      ""type"": ""node"",\n      ""request"": ""launch"",\n      ""runtimeExecutable"": ""${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/react-scripts"",      \n      ""args"": [\n        ""test"",\n        ""--runInBand"",\n        ""--no-cache"",\n        ""--env=jsdom""\n      ],\n      ""cwd"": ""${workspaceRoot}"",\n      ""protocol"": ""inspector"",\n      ""console"": ""integratedTerminal"",\n      ""internalConsoleOptions"": ""neverOpen""\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nDeveloping Components in Isolation\nUsually, in an app, you have a lot of UI components, and each of them has many different states.\nFor an example, a simple button component could have following states:\n\nIn a regular state, with a text label.\nIn the disabled mode.\nIn a loading state.\n\nUsually, it’s hard to see these states without running a sample app or some examples.\nCreate React App doesn’t include any tools for this by default, but you can easily add Storybook for React (source) or React Styleguidist (source) to your project. These are third-party tools that let you develop components and see all their states in isolation from your app.\n\nYou can also deploy your Storybook or style guide as a static app. This way, everyone in your team can view and review different states of UI components without starting a backend server or creating an account in your app.\nGetting Started with Storybook\nStorybook is a development environment for React UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.\nFirst, install the following npm package globally:\nnpm install -g @storybook/cli\nThen, run the following command inside your app’s directory:\ngetstorybook\nAfter that, follow the instructions on the screen.\nLearn more about React Storybook:\n\nScreencast: Getting Started with React Storybook\nGitHub Repo\nDocumentation\nSnapshot Testing UI with Storybook + addon/storyshot\n\nGetting Started with Styleguidist\nStyleguidist combines a style guide, where all your components are presented on a single page with their props documentation and usage examples, with an environment for developing components in isolation, similar to Storybook. In Styleguidist you write examples in Markdown, where each code snippet is rendered as a live editable playground.\nFirst, install Styleguidist:\nnpm install --save react-styleguidist\nAlternatively you may use yarn:\nyarn add react-styleguidist\nThen, add these scripts to your package.json:\n   ""scripts"": {\n+    ""styleguide"": ""styleguidist server"",\n+    ""styleguide:build"": ""styleguidist build"",\n     ""start"": ""react-scripts start"",\nThen, run the following command inside your app’s directory:\nnpm run styleguide\nAfter that, follow the instructions on the screen.\nLearn more about React Styleguidist:\n\nGitHub Repo\nDocumentation\n\nPublishing Components to npm\nCreate React App doesn\'t provide any built-in functionality to publish a component to npm. If you\'re ready to extract a component from your project so other people can use it, we recommend moving it to a separate directory outside of your project and then using a tool like nwb to prepare it for publishing.\nMaking a Progressive Web App\nBy default, the production build is a fully functional, offline-first\nProgressive Web App.\nProgressive Web Apps are faster and more reliable than traditional web pages, and provide an engaging mobile experience:\n\nAll static site assets are cached so that your page loads fast on subsequent visits, regardless of network connectivity (such as 2G or 3G). Updates are downloaded in the background.\nYour app will work regardless of network state, even if offline. This means your users will be able to use your app at 10,000 feet and on the subway.\nOn mobile devices, your app can be added directly to the user\'s home screen, app icon and all. You can also re-engage users using web push notifications. This eliminates the need for the app store.\n\nThe sw-precache-webpack-plugin\nis integrated into production configuration,\nand it will take care of generating a service worker file that will automatically\nprecache all of your local assets and keep them up to date as you deploy updates.\nThe service worker will use a cache-first strategy\nfor handling all requests for local assets, including the initial HTML, ensuring\nthat your web app is reliably fast, even on a slow or unreliable network.\nOpting Out of Caching\nIf you would prefer not to enable service workers prior to your initial\nproduction deployment, then remove the call to registerServiceWorker()\nfrom src/index.js.\nIf you had previously enabled service workers in your production deployment and\nhave decided that you would like to disable them for all your existing users,\nyou can swap out the call to registerServiceWorker() in\nsrc/index.js first by modifying the service worker import:\nimport { unregister } from \'./registerServiceWorker\';\nand then call unregister() instead.\nAfter the user visits a page that has unregister(),\nthe service worker will be uninstalled. Note that depending on how /service-worker.js is served,\nit may take up to 24 hours for the cache to be invalidated.\nOffline-First Considerations\n\n\nService workers require HTTPS,\nalthough to facilitate local testing, that policy\ndoes not apply to localhost.\nIf your production web server does not support HTTPS, then the service worker\nregistration will fail, but the rest of your web app will remain functional.\n\n\nService workers are not currently supported\nin all web browsers. Service worker registration won\'t be attempted\non browsers that lack support.\n\n\nThe service worker is only enabled in the production environment,\ne.g. the output of npm run build. It\'s recommended that you do not enable an\noffline-first service worker in a development environment, as it can lead to\nfrustration when previously cached assets are used and do not include the latest\nchanges you\'ve made locally.\n\n\nIf you need to test your offline-first service worker locally, build\nthe application (using npm run build) and run a simple http server from your\nbuild directory. After running the build script, create-react-app will give\ninstructions for one way to test your production build locally and the deployment instructions have\ninstructions for using other methods. Be sure to always use an\nincognito window to avoid complications with your browser cache.\n\n\nIf possible, configure your production environment to serve the generated\nservice-worker.js with HTTP caching disabled.\nIf that\'s not possible—GitHub Pages, for instance, does not\nallow you to change the default 10 minute HTTP cache lifetime—then be aware\nthat if you visit your production site, and then revisit again before\nservice-worker.js has expired from your HTTP cache, you\'ll continue to get\nthe previously cached assets from the service worker. If you have an immediate\nneed to view your updated production deployment, performing a shift-refresh\nwill temporarily disable the service worker and retrieve all assets from the\nnetwork.\n\n\nUsers aren\'t always familiar with offline-first web apps. It can be useful to\nlet the user know\nwhen the service worker has finished populating your caches (showing a ""This web\napp works offline!"" message) and also let them know when the service worker has\nfetched the latest updates that will be available the next time they load the\npage (showing a ""New content is available; please refresh."" message). Showing\nthis messages is currently left as an exercise to the developer, but as a\nstarting point, you can make use of the logic included in src/registerServiceWorker.js, which\ndemonstrates which service worker lifecycle events to listen for to detect each\nscenario, and which as a default, just logs appropriate messages to the\nJavaScript console.\n\n\nBy default, the generated service worker file will not intercept or cache any\ncross-origin traffic, like HTTP API requests,\nimages, or embeds loaded from a different domain. If you would like to use a\nruntime caching strategy for those requests, you can eject\nand then configure the\nruntimeCaching\noption in the SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin section of\nwebpack.config.prod.js.\n\n\nProgressive Web App Metadata\nThe default configuration includes a web app manifest located at\npublic/manifest.json, that you can customize with\ndetails specific to your web application.\nWhen a user adds a web app to their homescreen using Chrome or Firefox on\nAndroid, the metadata in manifest.json determines what\nicons, names, and branding colors to use when the web app is displayed.\nThe Web App Manifest guide\nprovides more context about what each field means, and how your customizations\nwill affect your users\' experience.\nAnalyzing the Bundle Size\nSource map explorer analyzes\nJavaScript bundles using the source maps. This helps you understand where code\nbloat is coming from.\nTo add Source map explorer to a Create React App project, follow these steps:\nnpm install --save source-map-explorer\nAlternatively you may use yarn:\nyarn add source-map-explorer\nThen in package.json, add the following line to scripts:\n   ""scripts"": {\n+    ""analyze"": ""source-map-explorer build/static/js/main.*"",\n     ""start"": ""react-scripts start"",\n     ""build"": ""react-scripts build"",\n     ""test"": ""react-scripts test --env=jsdom"",\nThen to analyze the bundle run the production build then run the analyze\nscript.\nnpm run build\nnpm run analyze\n\nDeployment\nnpm run build creates a build directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static paths like /static/js/main.<hash>.js are served with the contents of the /static/js/main.<hash>.js file.\nStatic Server\nFor environments using Node, the easiest way to handle this would be to install serve and let it handle the rest:\nnpm install -g serve\nserve -s build\nThe last command shown above will serve your static site on the port 5000. Like many of serve’s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the -p or --port flags.\nRun this command to get a full list of the options available:\nserve -h\nOther Solutions\nYou don’t necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It works just as fine integrated into an existing dynamic one.\nHere’s a programmatic example using Node and Express:\nconst express = require(\'express\');\nconst path = require(\'path\');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, \'build\')));\n\napp.get(\'/\', function (req, res) {\n  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, \'build\', \'index.html\'));\n});\n\napp.listen(9000);\nThe choice of your server software isn’t important either. Since Create React App is completely platform-agnostic, there’s no need to explicitly use Node.\nThe build folder with static assets is the only output produced by Create React App.\nHowever this is not quite enough if you use client-side routing. Read the next section if you want to support URLs like /todos/42 in your single-page app.\nServing Apps with Client-Side Routing\nIf you use routers that use the HTML5 pushState history API under the hood (for example, React Router with browserHistory), many static file servers will fail. For example, if you used React Router with a route for /todos/42, the development server will respond to localhost:3000/todos/42 properly, but an Express serving a production build as above will not.\nThis is because when there is a fresh page load for a /todos/42, the server looks for the file build/todos/42 and does not find it. The server needs to be configured to respond to a request to /todos/42 by serving index.html. For example, we can amend our Express example above to serve index.html for any unknown paths:\n app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, \'build\')));\n\n-app.get(\'/\', function (req, res) {\n+app.get(\'/*\', function (req, res) {\n   res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, \'build\', \'index.html\'));\n });\nIf you’re using Apache HTTP Server, you need to create a .htaccess file in the public folder that looks like this:\n    Options -MultiViews\n    RewriteEngine On\n    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\n    RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]\n\nIt will get copied to the build folder when you run npm run build.\nIf you’re using Apache Tomcat, you need to follow this Stack Overflow answer.\nNow requests to /todos/42 will be handled correctly both in development and in production.\nOn a production build, and in a browser that supports service workers,\nthe service worker will automatically handle all navigation requests, like for\n/todos/42, by serving the cached copy of your index.html. This\nservice worker navigation routing can be configured or disabled by\nejecting and then modifying the\nnavigateFallback\nand navigateFallbackWhitelist\noptions of the SWPreachePlugin configuration.\nWhen users install your app to the homescreen of their device the default configuration will make a shortcut to /index.html. This may not work for client-side routers which expect the app to be served from /. Edit the web app manifest at public/manifest.json and change start_url to match the required URL scheme, for example:\n  ""start_url"": ""."",\nBuilding for Relative Paths\nBy default, Create React App produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root.\nTo override this, specify the homepage in your package.json, for example:\n  ""homepage"": ""http://mywebsite.com/relativepath"",\nThis will let Create React App correctly infer the root path to use in the generated HTML file.\nNote: If you are using react-router@^4, you can root <Link>s using the basename prop on any <Router>.\nMore information here.\n\nFor example:\n<BrowserRouter basename=""/calendar""/>\n<Link to=""/today""/> // renders <a href=""/calendar/today"">\nServing the Same Build from Different Paths\n\nNote: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.9.0 and higher.\n\nIf you are not using the HTML5 pushState history API or not using client-side routing at all, it is unnecessary to specify the URL from which your app will be served. Instead, you can put this in your package.json:\n  ""homepage"": ""."",\nThis will make sure that all the asset paths are relative to index.html. You will then be able to move your app from http://mywebsite.com to http://mywebsite.com/relativepath or even http://mywebsite.com/relative/path without having to rebuild it.\nAzure\nSee this blog post on how to deploy your React app to Microsoft Azure.\nSee this blog post or this repo for a way to use automatic deployment to Azure App Service.\nFirebase\nInstall the Firebase CLI if you haven’t already by running npm install -g firebase-tools. Sign up for a Firebase account and create a new project. Run firebase login and login with your previous created Firebase account.\nThen run the firebase init command from your project’s root. You need to choose the Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites and choose the Firebase project you created in the previous step. You will need to agree with database.rules.json being created, choose build as the public directory, and also agree to Configure as a single-page app by replying with y.\n    === Project Setup\n\n    First, let\'s associate this project directory with a Firebase project.\n    You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,\n    but for now we\'ll just set up a default project.\n\n    ? What Firebase project do you want to associate as default? Example app (example-app-fd690)\n\n    === Database Setup\n\n    Firebase Realtime Database Rules allow you to define how your data should be\n    structured and when your data can be read from and written to.\n\n    ? What file should be used for Database Rules? database.rules.json\n    ✔  Database Rules for example-app-fd690 have been downloaded to database.rules.json.\n    Future modifications to database.rules.json will update Database Rules when you run\n    firebase deploy.\n\n    === Hosting Setup\n\n    Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that\n    will contain Hosting assets to uploaded with firebase deploy. If you\n    have a build process for your assets, use your build\'s output directory.\n\n    ? What do you want to use as your public directory? build\n    ?

Yes\n    ✔  Wrote build/index.html\n\n    i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...\n    i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...\n\n    ✔  Firebase initialization complete!\nIMPORTANT: you need to set proper HTTP caching headers for service-worker.js file in firebase.json file or you will not be able to see changes after first deployment (issue #2440). It should be added inside ""hosting"" key like next:\n{\n  ""hosting"": {\n    ...\n    ""headers"": [\n      {""source"": ""/service-worker.js"", ""headers"": [{""key"": ""Cache-Control"", ""value"": ""no-cache""}]}\n    ]\n    ...\n\nNow, after you create a production build with npm run build, you can deploy it by running firebase deploy.\n    === Deploying to \'example-app-fd690\'...\n\n    i  deploying database, hosting\n    ✔  database: rules ready to deploy.\n    i  hosting: preparing build directory for upload...\n    Uploading: [==============================          ] 75%✔  hosting: build folder uploaded successfully\n    ✔  hosting: 8 files uploaded successfully\n    i  starting release process (may take several minutes)...\n\n    ✔  Deploy complete!\n\n    Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/example-app-fd690/overview\n    Hosting URL: https://example-app-fd690.firebaseapp.com\nFor more information see Add Firebase to your JavaScript Project.\nGitHub Pages\n\nNote: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.2.0 and higher.\n\nStep 1: Add homepage to package.json\nThe step below is important!\nIf you skip it, your app will not deploy correctly.\nOpen your package.json and add a homepage field for your project:\n  ""homepage"": ""https://myusername.github.io/my-app"",\nor for a GitHub user page:\n  ""homepage"": ""https://myusername.github.io"",\nCreate React App uses the homepage field to determine the root URL in the built HTML file.\nStep 2: Install gh-pages and add deploy to scripts in package.json\nNow, whenever you run npm run build, you will see a cheat sheet with instructions on how to deploy to GitHub Pages.\nTo publish it at https://myusername.github.io/my-app, run:\nnpm install --save gh-pages\nAlternatively you may use yarn:\nyarn add gh-pages\nAdd the following scripts in your package.json:\n  ""scripts"": {\n+   ""predeploy"": ""npm run build"",\n+   ""deploy"": ""gh-pages -d build"",\n    ""start"": ""react-scripts start"",\n    ""build"": ""react-scripts build"",\nThe predeploy script will run automatically before deploy is run.\nIf you are deploying to a GitHub user page instead of a project page you\'ll need to make two\nadditional modifications:\n\nFirst, change your repository\'s source branch to be any branch other than master.\nAdditionally, tweak your package.json scripts to push deployments to master:\n\n  ""scripts"": {\n    ""predeploy"": ""npm run build"",\n-   ""deploy"": ""gh-pages -d build"",\n+   ""deploy"": ""gh-pages -b master -d build"",\nStep 3: Deploy the site by running npm run deploy\nThen run:\nnpm run deploy\nStep 4: Ensure your project’s settings use gh-pages\nFinally, make sure GitHub Pages option in your GitHub project settings is set to use the gh-pages branch:\n\nStep 5: Optionally, configure the domain\nYou can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a CNAME file to the public/ folder.\nNotes on client-side routing\nGitHub Pages doesn’t support routers that use the HTML5 pushState history API under the hood (for example, React Router using browserHistory). This is because when there is a fresh page load for a url like http://user.github.io/todomvc/todos/42, where /todos/42 is a frontend route, the GitHub Pages server returns 404 because it knows nothing of /todos/42. If you want to add a router to a project hosted on GitHub Pages, here are a couple of solutions:\n\nYou could switch from using HTML5 history API to routing with hashes. If you use React Router, you can switch to hashHistory for this effect, but the URL will be longer and more verbose (for example, http://user.github.io/todomvc/#/todos/42?_k=yknaj). Read more about different history implementations in React Router.\nAlternatively, you can use a trick to teach GitHub Pages to handle 404 by redirecting to your index.html page with a special redirect parameter. You would need to add a 404.html file with the redirection code to the build folder before deploying your project, and you’ll need to add code handling the redirect parameter to index.html. You can find a detailed explanation of this technique in this guide.\n\nTroubleshooting\n""/dev/tty: No such a device or address""\nIf, when deploying, you get /dev/tty: No such a device or address or a similar error, try the follwing:\n\nCreate a new Personal Access Token\ngit remote set-url origin https://<user>:<token>@github.com/<user>/<repo> .\nTry npm run deploy again\n\nHeroku\nUse the Heroku Buildpack for Create React App.\nYou can find instructions in Deploying React with Zero Configuration.\nResolving Heroku Deployment Errors\nSometimes npm run build works locally but fails during deploy via Heroku. Following are the most common cases.\n""Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve \'file\' or \'directory\'""\nIf you get something like this:\nremote: Failed to create a production build. Reason:\nremote: Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve \'file\' or \'directory\'\nMyDirectory in /tmp/build_1234/src\n\nIt means you need to ensure that the lettercase of the file or directory you import matches the one you see on your filesystem or on GitHub.\nThis is important because Linux (the operating system used by Heroku) is case sensitive. So MyDirectory and mydirectory are two distinct directories and thus, even though the project builds locally, the difference in case breaks the import statements on Heroku remotes.\n""Could not find a required file.""\nIf you exclude or ignore necessary files from the package you will see a error similar this one:\nremote: Could not find a required file.\nremote:   Name: `index.html`\nremote:   Searched in: /tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/public\nremote:\nremote: npm ERR!

You can use now to deploy your app for free.\n\n\nInstall the now command-line tool either via the recommended desktop tool or via node with npm install -g now.\n\n\nBuild your app by running npm run build.\n\n\nMove into the build directory by running cd build.\n\n\nRun now --name your-project-name from within the build directory. You will see a now.sh URL in your output like this:\n> Ready! https://your-project-name-tpspyhtdtk.now.sh (copied to clipboard)\n\nPaste that URL into your browser when the build is complete, and you will see your deployed app.\n\n\nDetails are available in this article.\nS3 and CloudFront\nSee this blog post on how to deploy your React app to Amazon Web Services S3 and CloudFront.\nSurge\nInstall the Surge CLI if you haven’t already by running npm install -g surge. Run the surge command and log in you or create a new account.\nWhen asked about the project path, make sure to specify the build folder, for example:\n       project path: /path/to/project/build\nNote that in order to support routers that use HTML5 pushState API, you may want to rename the index.html in your build folder to 200.html before deploying to Surge. This ensures that every URL falls back to that file.\nAdvanced Configuration\nYou can adjust various development and production settings by setting environment variables in your shell or with .env.\n\n\n\nVariable\nDevelopment\nProduction\nUsage\n\n\n\n\nBROWSER\n✅\n❌\nBy default, Create React App will open the default system browser, favoring Chrome on macOS. Specify a browser to override this behavior, or set it to none to disable it completely. If you need to customize the way the browser is launched, you can specify a node script instead. Any arguments passed to npm start will also be passed to this script, and the url where your app is served will be the last argument. Your script\'s file name must have the .js extension.\n\n\nHOST\n✅\n❌\nBy default, the development web server binds to localhost. You may use this variable to specify a different host.\n\n\nPORT\n✅\n❌\nBy default, the development web server will attempt to listen on port 3000 or prompt you to attempt the next available port. You may use this variable to specify a different port.\n\n\nHTTPS\n✅\n❌\nWhen set to true, Create React App will run the development server in https mode.\n\n\nPUBLIC_URL\n❌\n✅\nCreate React App assumes your application is hosted at the serving web server\'s root or a subpath as specified in package.json (homepage). Normally, Create React App ignores the hostname. You may use this variable to force assets to be referenced verbatim to the url you provide (hostname included). This may be particularly useful when using a CDN to host your application.\n\n\nCI\n🔶\n✅\nWhen set to true, Create React App treats warnings as failures in the build. It also makes the test runner non-watching. Most CIs set this flag by default.\n\n\nREACT_EDITOR\n✅\n❌\nWhen an app crashes in development, you will see an error overlay with clickable stack trace. When you click on it, Create React App will try to determine the editor you are using based on currently running processes, and open the relevant source file. You can send a pull request to detect your editor of choice. Setting this environment variable overrides the automatic detection. If you do it, make sure your systems PATH environment variable points to your editor’s bin folder. You can also set it to none to disable it completely.\n\n\nCHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING\n✅\n❌\nWhen set to true, the watcher runs in polling mode, as necessary inside a VM. Use this option if npm start isn\'t detecting changes.\n\n\nGENERATE_SOURCEMAP\n❌\n✅\nWhen set to false, source maps are not generated for a production build. This solves OOM issues on some smaller machines.\n\n\nNODE_PATH\n✅\n✅\nSame as NODE_PATH in Node.js, but only relative folders are allowed. Can be handy for emulating a monorepo setup by setting NODE_PATH=src.\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nnpm start doesn’t detect changes\nWhen you save a file while npm start is running, the browser should refresh with the updated code.\nIf this doesn’t happen, try one of the following workarounds:\n\nIf your project is in a Dropbox folder, try moving it out.\nIf the watcher doesn’t see a file called index.js and you’re referencing it by the folder name, you need to restart the watcher due to a Webpack bug.\nSome editors like Vim and IntelliJ have a “safe write” feature that currently breaks the watcher. You will need to disable it. Follow the instructions in “Adjusting Your Text Editor”.\nIf your project path contains parentheses, try moving the project to a path without them. This is caused by a Webpack watcher bug.\nOn Linux and macOS, you might need to tweak system settings to allow more watchers.\nIf the project runs inside a virtual machine such as (a Vagrant provisioned) VirtualBox, create an .env file in your project directory if it doesn’t exist, and add CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true to it. This ensures that the next time you run npm start, the watcher uses the polling mode, as necessary inside a VM.\n\nIf none of these solutions help please leave a comment in this thread.\nnpm test hangs on macOS Sierra\nIf you run npm test and the console gets stuck after printing react-scripts test --env=jsdom to the console there might be a problem with your Watchman installation as described in facebookincubator/create-react-app#713.\nWe recommend deleting node_modules in your project and running npm install (or yarn if you use it) first. If it doesn\'t help, you can try one of the numerous workarounds mentioned in these issues:\n\nfacebook/jest#1767\nfacebook/watchman#358\nember-cli/ember-cli#6259\n\nIt is reported that installing Watchman 4.7.0 or newer fixes the issue. If you use Homebrew, you can run these commands to update it:\nwatchman shutdown-server\nbrew update\nbrew reinstall watchman\n\nYou can find other installation methods on the Watchman documentation page.\nIf this still doesn’t help, try running launchctl unload -F ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.facebook.watchman.plist.\nThere are also reports that uninstalling Watchman fixes the issue. So if nothing else helps, remove it from your system and try again.\nnpm run build exits too early\nIt is reported that npm run build can fail on machines with limited memory and no swap space, which is common in cloud environments. Even with small projects this command can increase RAM usage in your system by hundreds of megabytes, so if you have less than 1 GB of available memory your build is likely to fail with the following message:\n\nThe build failed because the process exited too early. This probably means the system ran out of memory or someone called kill -9 on the process.\n\nIf you are completely sure that you didn\'t terminate the process, consider adding some swap space to the machine you’re building on, or build the project locally.\nnpm run build fails on Heroku\nThis may be a problem with case sensitive filenames.\nPlease refer to this section.\nMoment.js locales are missing\nIf you use a Moment.js, you might notice that only the English locale is available by default. This is because the locale files are large, and you probably only need a subset of all the locales provided by Moment.js.\nTo add a specific Moment.js locale to your bundle, you need to import it explicitly.\nFor example:\nimport moment from \'moment\';\nimport \'moment/locale/fr\';\nIf import multiple locales this way, you can later switch between them by calling moment.locale() with the locale name:\nimport moment from \'moment\';\nimport \'moment/locale/fr\';\nimport \'moment/locale/es\';\n\n// ...\n\nmoment.locale(\'fr\');\nThis will only work for locales that have been explicitly imported before.\nnpm run build fails to minify\nSome third-party packages don\'t compile their code to ES5 before publishing to npm. This often causes problems in the ecosystem because neither browsers (except for most modern versions) nor some tools currently support all ES6 features. We recommend to publish code on npm as ES5 at least for a few more years.\n\nTo resolve this:\n\nOpen an issue on the dependency\'s issue tracker and ask that the package be published pre-compiled.\n\n\nNote: Create React App can consume both CommonJS and ES modules. For Node.js compatibility, it is recommended that the main entry point is CommonJS. However, they can optionally provide an ES module entry point with the module field in package.json. Note that even if a library provides an ES Modules version, it should still precompile other ES6 features to ES5 if it intends to support older browsers.\n\n\n\nFork the package and publish a corrected version yourself.\n\n\nIf the dependency is small enough, copy it to your src/ folder and treat it as application code.\n\n\nIn the future, we might start automatically compiling incompatible third-party modules, but it is not currently supported. This approach would also slow down the production builds.\nAlternatives to Ejecting\nEjecting lets you customize anything, but from that point on you have to maintain the configuration and scripts yourself. This can be daunting if you have many similar projects. In such cases instead of ejecting we recommend to fork react-scripts and any other packages you need. This article dives into how to do it in depth. You can find more discussion in this issue.\nSomething Missing?\nIf you have ideas for more “How To” recipes that should be on this page, let us know or contribute some!\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Nure', 'info_list': ['1', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 5, 2021', 'HTML', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 7, 2020', 'Kotlin', 'Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 29, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 3, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'C', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 4, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '37 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/e2hum', 'info_list': ['1', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 5, 2021', 'HTML', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 7, 2020', 'Kotlin', 'Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 29, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 3, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'C', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 4, 2020']}","{'location': 'KOLKATA', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '3 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Bluetooth-control-Arduino-Robot\nBluetooth Control Robot\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/sagnikrivud', 'info_list': ['1', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 5, 2021', 'HTML', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 7, 2020', 'Kotlin', 'Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 29, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 3, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'C', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 4, 2020']}"

Since this localization and map-building relies on the visual sensing of landmarks, this is a computer vision problem.\nNotebooks\nThe project will be broken up into three Python notebooks; the first two are for exploration of provided code, and a review of SLAM architectures, only Notebook 3 and the robot_class.py file will be graded:\nNotebook 1 : Robot Moving and Sensing - Exploring provided starter code\nNotebook 2 : Omega and Xi, Constraints - Reviewing SLAM architecture\nNotebook 3 : Landmark Detection and Tracking - Defining and Testing GraphSLAM algorithm\nResults\nThe final position of the robot and landmarks in its world estimated by the GraphSLAM algorithm (from noisy motion and measurement data) are visualized as shown below.\n\nTrue Final Pose: [x=6.41402 y=66.72919]\nEstimated Final Pose: [x=6.01922, y=66.35595]\nL2 distance = 0.5433\nAcknowledgement\nNotebook Documentation, Images and Starter Code are part of project files provided by Udacity in the Computer Vision Nanodegree.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/eazydammy', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', 'Updated Dec 30, 2019', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', '1', 'CSS', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 18, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 3, 2021', 'HTML', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Mar 7, 2020', 'Updated Jan 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 14, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['Coindroids.com\nThe next generation of Coindroids is in the works.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Coindroids', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', 'Updated Dec 30, 2019', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', '1', 'CSS', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 18, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 3, 2021', 'HTML', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Mar 7, 2020', 'Updated Jan 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 14, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '849 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['\n\n\n\nWeb application with Python, Flask and JavaScript(AJAX)\n\nGRANDPY BOT, PLACES INFORMATIONS\n\nTools:\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI:\n\n\n\nGET STARTED\n\nThe web app is here GrandPy Bot\n\nFEATURES\n\nAsk Grandpy about any places,\nHe will find the address and show you on a map,\nThen he will tell you a story about this place.\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/sylrie', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', 'Updated Dec 30, 2019', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', '1', 'CSS', 'Updated Jan 5, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 18, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 3, 2021', 'HTML', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Mar 7, 2020', 'Updated Jan 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 14, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['2020RobotCode\n2020 Infinite Recharge Robot Code\nINFINITE RECHARGE\n\nThis years game info:\nmore game info:\nFIRST FAQ:\nTwitter:\n\nHow to contribute with GitHub\n\nThe Master Branch is a copy of the latest working code.

Inspired from @Team254 and some of the work that I did on @Team3310, this template will allow you to start working with effective path following autonomous code for the 2020 FRC Season. I worked to make this as comprehensible as possible so if you have any feedback I am more than welcome to it!\nThe code is divided into several packages, each responsible for a different aspect of robot function. Some of the packages you will see in the project overlap between this project and Team254 this repository so this README will highlight some of the changes that were made in the project. I highly recommend you go read 254\'s README for more information about some of these packages along with additional information found in that class\'s Java files.\nProject Features\n\n\nPath following with a nonlinear feedback controller and splines\nTo control autonomous driving, the robot utilizes a nonlinear feedback controller and drives paths constructed of Quintic Hermite Splines.\n\n\nPath generation and visualization via Java app\nHawk Path, an external Java webapp, is used for fast and simple path creation. The app allows a user to create and visualize autonomous paths.\n\n\nGetting Started\nGeneral\n\nClone this repository or use the Use this Template button to get a version of this repository on your computer.\nMake sure that you have a folder on your computer that is linked to your repository if you are using source control.\nRun ./gradlew to download Gradle and needed FRC libraries\nRun ./gradlew tasks to see available build options\n\nVSCode\nVisual Studio Code (Official IDE)\nGet the WPILib extension for easiest use from the VSCode Marketplace - Requires Java 11 or greater\nIn .vscode/settings.json, set the User Setting, java.home, to the correct directory pointing to your JDK 11 dir\n\nEclipse\nRun ./gradlew eclipse\nOpen Eclipse and go to ""File > Open Projects"" from ""File System...""\nSet the import source to the 2020-Template folder then click finish\n\nIntelliJ\nIf you used the Use This Template button, you can open the repository through the Open Project through version control option\nor\nRun ./gradlew idea\nOpen the 2020-Template folder\nBuilding/Deploying to the Robot\nRun ./gradlew build to build the code.

You select a StartingPosition, a DesiredMode which allows for different actions depending on the mode you are running your auto in instead of to represent a routine i.e. you may zero you elevator in teleOp Init if you are running in test mode but you may want to hold it\'s current position if you are running in competition mode, and the routine you would like to run. Every time a change is made on the smart dashboard this class\'s methods will update to set your auto to your desired selection.\nRemoved mFeildState (2018 Game Specifics), Renamed for simplicity\n\n\n\n\nfrc.team3039.robot.auto\nHandles the execution of autonomous routines and contains actions and routines packages\nAutoRoutineBase AutoModeBase\n\n\nAutoRoutineBase is the basis of the robot\'s autonomous routines. A LazyLoadTracketory class was implemented in the class. The LazyLoadTrajectory class allows you to only generate trajectories when you select your autonomous routine instead of generating all of the trajectories when some may be unneeded for a specific match. This was added to limit processing over the FMS and remove unneeded action.\nRenamed because it sets up the autonomous routines (no longer known as a mode)\n\n\n\n\nfrc.team3039.robot.auto.actions\n\nIncludes all actions used during the autonomous period, which all share a common interface, Action (also in this package).

"{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '22 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['2020-Template\nProject Description\nThe goal of this project is to simplify, organize, and consolidate some very complex autonomous code to work for your team with minimal changes. Inspired from @Team254 and some of the work that I did on @Team3310, this template will allow you to start working with effective path following autonomous code for the 2020 FRC Season. I worked to make this as comprehensible as possible so if you have any feedback I am more than welcome to it!\nThe code is divided into several packages, each responsible for a different aspect of robot function. Some of the packages you will see in the project overlap between this project and Team254 this repository so this README will highlight some of the changes that were made in the project. I highly recommend you go read 254\'s README for more information about some of these packages along with additional information found in that class\'s Java files.\nProject Features\n\n\nPath following with a nonlinear feedback controller and splines\nTo control autonomous driving, the robot utilizes a nonlinear feedback controller and drives paths constructed of Quintic Hermite Splines.\n\n\nPath generation and visualization via Java app\nHawk Path, an external Java webapp, is used for fast and simple path creation. The app allows a user to create and visualize autonomous paths.\n\n\nGetting Started\nGeneral\n\nClone this repository or use the Use this Template button to get a version of this repository on your computer.\nMake sure that you have a folder on your computer that is linked to your repository if you are using source control.\nRun ./gradlew to download Gradle and needed FRC libraries\nRun ./gradlew tasks to see available build options\n\nVSCode\nVisual Studio Code (Official IDE)\nGet the WPILib extension for easiest use from the VSCode Marketplace - Requires Java 11 or greater\nIn .vscode/settings.json, set the User Setting, java.home, to the correct directory pointing to your JDK 11 dir\n\nEclipse\nRun ./gradlew eclipse\nOpen Eclipse and go to ""File > Open Projects"" from ""File System...""\nSet the import source to the 2020-Template folder then click finish\n\nIntelliJ\nIf you used the Use This Template button, you can open the repository through the Open Project through version control option\nor\nRun ./gradlew idea\nOpen the 2020-Template folder\nBuilding/Deploying to the Robot\nRun ./gradlew build to build the code. Use the --info flag for more details\nRun ./gradlew deploy to deploy to the robot in Terminal (Mac) or Powershell (Windows)\n\nPackage Description\nClass Addition\nClass Removal\n\n\nfrc.team3039.robot\nHolds all the folders that control robot actions, along with files such as the numerical constants used throughout the code, and classes like Robot which facilitates robot control.\nAutoRoutineSelector AutoModeSelector\n\n\nAutoRoutineSelector handles all of the autonomous selection and setup. You select a StartingPosition, a DesiredMode which allows for different actions depending on the mode you are running your auto in instead of to represent a routine i.e. you may zero you elevator in teleOp Init if you are running in test mode but you may want to hold it\'s current position if you are running in competition mode, and the routine you would like to run. Every time a change is made on the smart dashboard this class\'s methods will update to set your auto to your desired selection.\nRemoved mFeildState (2018 Game Specifics), Renamed for simplicity\n\n\n\n\nfrc.team3039.robot.auto\nHandles the execution of autonomous routines and contains actions and routines packages\nAutoRoutineBase AutoModeBase\n\n\nAutoRoutineBase is the basis of the robot\'s autonomous routines. A LazyLoadTracketory class was implemented in the class. The LazyLoadTrajectory class allows you to only generate trajectories when you select your autonomous routine instead of generating all of the trajectories when some may be unneeded for a specific match. This was added to limit processing over the FMS and remove unneeded action.\nRenamed because it sets up the autonomous routines (no longer known as a mode)\n\n\n\n\nfrc.team3039.robot.auto.actions\n\nIncludes all actions used during the autonomous period, which all share a common interface, Action (also in this package). Examples include auto vision and driving a trajectory. Routines interact with the subsystems, which interact with the hardware.\n\nCharacterizeDrivebase\n\nCharacterizeDrivebase combines the collect acceleration and velocity data actions along with CalculateCharacteriztion to return the kv and ka values that will be used to tune your robot constants.\n\nCalculateCharacterization\n\nCalculateCharacterization prints the velocity and acceleration values calculated from the CharacterizeDrivebase Action.\n\nWaitUntilCrossXBoundary WaitUntilCrossXBoundaryCommand\nWaitUntilCrossXBoundary  has added functionality for when the robots x is either moving positively or negatively into a certain boundary. i.e. Positive (moving towards the middle of the field) Negative (moving toward the alliance wall)\n\n\ncom.team254.frc2018.auto.creators\nContains all the auto mode creators, which select the correct auto mode to run based on user input and FMS data.\nRemoved because this was 2018 game-specific functionality\n\n\nfrc.team3039.robot.auto.routines com.team254.frc2018.auto.modes\nIt contains all autonomous routines. Autonomous routines are set up similar to command groups where actions run in a specified order\nRenamed for simplicity\n\n\nThis will not give you perfect understanding of the code, you will have to look at it to understand but this should be a guide to help you along.\nAuthor\n\nJoshua Lewis - Initial work - Repositories\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nTeam254: The Chessy Poof\nTeam3310: Brian

Emphasis is lain on lateral displacement control, for this reason, a constant longitudinal velocity is assumed, and perfect trajectory tracking along the longitudinal axis is assumed.\nA configuration space of 50m by 50m is considered with obstacles scatered around this space. The obstacles in this study are assumed to be static and of rounded geometry of radius 1m. It is also assumed that their positions are known.\nPath planning and trajectory generation are essential components of any obstacle avoidance scheme. In this study, these two important elements are provided using the concept of artificial potential fields (APFs).\n\nPATH PLANNING AND TRAJECTORY GENERATION\nThe concept of path planning using APFs was first proposed by Oussama Khatib in 1986. Since then numerous studies have been carried out to investigate and further enhance this technique. While there are numerous problems associated with path planning using APFs, it is a very good concept to study as it provides intuition into the path planning process.\nAn attractive potential is setup such that its minimum is at the goal position, while a repulsive potential is setup at and around the position of each obstacle. These two potentials are superimposed and a universal potential field is produced, along which the AMR is guided to its goal position.\nThe attractive potential used in this study is given as:\n\nThe repulsive potential is given as:\n\nwhere:\nK_att, K_rep, and p_0 are constants.\nX is the current position, X_goal the goal position, and X_obs the position of the current obstacle (note that the repulsive potential is formulated for each known obstacle).\nThe universal potential field is generated as:\n\nIn this study, gradient descent approach is used to guide the AMR along the universal potential to its goal position while avoiding the obestacles in its way. The driving force (negative gradient) of the AMR towards its goal position resulting from the attractive potential is given as:\n\n\nFollowing the same pattern, the driving force propelling the AMR away from obstacles modelled by the repulsive potential is given as:\n\n\nThe output of the path planning and trajectory generation algorithm is a trajectory with longitudinal and lateral positions via which the AMR can get to its goal position while avoiding the obstacles in its path. A trajectory of the yaw angle the AMR should assume is also calculated from the velocity vector at every time instance.\nAssociated Scripts\n\ntrajectory_generator_apf.m\ntrajectory_generator_apf_with_plot.m\n\n\nMODEL\nThe AMR was modelled using the linearized lateral 2 DOF bicycle model of a vehicle. While this model has been extensively streamlined, it still provides valuable insight into the lateral dynamics of a vehicle.\nA small AMR with a single front wheel and 2 rear wheel is considered. More information about the considered model is given below:\n\nMass, m: 505kg\nYaw moment of inertia, I_zz: 808.5kg.m^2\nFront tyre cornering stiffness, C_f: 40kN/rad\nRear tyre cornering stiffness, C_r: 40kN/rad\nDistance of front wheel from center of mass, a: 0.35m\nDistance of rear wheels from center of mass, b: 0.4125m\n\nThe state space representation of the model is given as:\n\n\nTwo variants of the model are specified, the first is a SISO model with the front wheel angle as the input and the lateral displacement of center of mass as the output (lateral_2_dof_model.m). The second variant has the yaw angle as an additional output, effectively making one input and 2 outputs (yaw_lateral_2_dof_model.m).\nAssociated Scripts\n\nlateral_2_dof_model.m\nyaw_lateral_2_dof_model.m\n\n\nCONTROLLER DESIGN\nThree different controllers were designed during the course of this study. While the main focus is on model predictive control (MPC), a PID controller was also designed as a juxtaposing mechanism. Two MPC controllers were designed, one using the SISO model and the other using the SIMO model of the AMR.\nPID Controller\nThe PID controller was designed using MATLAB's pidTuner tool. This model can be viewed in pid_control_sim.slx.\nMPC Controller Design\nModel predictive control has risen in popularity in both research and industry in recent years. This can mainly be attributed to rapid advances in computing technologies. Of all its pros, MPC was considered in this study largely because it allows embedding model constraints in the controller. This made it possible to specify rate and limit constraints on the control input (front wheel steering angle). The SIMO-based MPC controller has an equally weighted output (i.e. deviations from the reference the lateral displacement has an equally weighted effect on the optimization cost function as deviations from the reference yaw angle).\nBoth MPC controllers are preset with a prediction horizon of 25 time steps and a control horizon of 4 time steps on a sampling time of 0.05 seconds.\nCONSTRAINTS:\n\nMaximum front wheel angle: 40 degrees\nMinimum front wheel angle: -40 degrees\nMaximum front wheel angular velocity: 30 degrees/second\n\nThe MPCs were designed using the MPC Controller model from Simulink's Model Predictive Control Toolbox.\nAssociated Scripts\n\npid_control.m\nsiso_mpc_control.m\nsimo_mpc_control.m\n\n\nSIMULATION\nExtensive simulation was carried out to examine the effects of the designed controllers on a representative model of the Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR). The Vehicle Body 3DOF Single Track model from Simulink's Vehicle Dynamics Blockset was used for simulations. In all simulation scenarios, perfect tracking of the AMR's longitudinal position is assumed since this study focuses on lateral displacement control. Hence, the refrence signal is the lateral position trajectory produced by the APF path planning algorithm. In addition to the lateral position reference, the yaw angle reference is also provided as reference for the SIMO-based MPC.\nPerformance of the controllers are compared on the basis of a scaled error norm which is the L2 norm of the error at each sampling instance divided by the number of samples.\nSCENARIO 1\nIn this simulation scenario, a goal position of (50, 31) was set and obstacles were placed at (14.87, 33.28),  (10, 8), (26, 12), (19, 19), and (34, 23). The trajectory generator generated a suitable trajectory that avoids all known obstacles and assumes the AMR is at an initial position of (0, 0). The two MPCs were simulated with a sampling time of 0.05 seconds, while the PID controller was simulated with a sampling time of 0.01 seconds.\nIn this scenario, the PID controller performed best, with a negligible scaled error norm of 0.0022. Next in line, although by a very thin margin is the SIMO-based MPC controller with a scaled error norm of 0.3647. And finally, comes the SISO-based MPC with an error norm of 0.4713. All three controllers provided control signals which are physically realizable.\nSCENARIO 2\nThe same goal point and obstacle positions from the 2 previous scenarios are retained. Also, the initial position of the AMR is put back at (0, 0). The path planning parameters are modified to further increase the region of influence of the obstacles and change the course of the AMR's travel.\nThe PID controller performed quite well, yielding a scaled error norm of about 0.0044. However, the control signal generated cannot be physically realized. The required front wheel angle attained a magnitude of about 5 radians at some point.\nThe SIMO-based MPC was able to track the planned path with a scaled error norm of 0.3980. And as expected with an MPC with output constraints, the control signal produced was within a physically realizable limit.\nThe SISO-based MPC albeit with a larger scaled error norm of about 0.4938, was also able to take the AMR through the planned path with physically realizable control output.\nSCENARIO 2\nThe same goal position and obstacle positions from scenario 1 are used. However, the initial position of the AMR was offset by an error, such that the new initial position was (0, 1) while the path planning algorithm still planed a trajectory that assumed an initial position of (0, 0). The path planning parameters were tweaked a little, such that the region of influence of the obstacles were increased.\nLike scenario 1, the PID controller had a lower scaled error norm in this scenario also (about 0.0579). Under the influence of the PID controller, the AMR quickly converged to and strictly followed the reference signal. However, the control signals it generated look impossible to implement in a real life situation. It produced wheel angles with magnitude as high as 120 radians.\nThe SISO-based MPC could not successfully control the AMR to track the reference in this scenario. It produced a scaled error norm of about 14.55. The perfect longitudinal displacement tracking was ommited for this particular case and the actual longitudinal output of the simulation model was used such that the movement of the AMR in circles is evident. However, by increasing the prediction horizon to 35 time steps (from 25), the SISO MPC was able to control the AMR to converge to, and track the reference with a scaled error norm of 0.7093.\nAssociated Scripts\n\ninit_scen_1.m\ninit_scene_2.m\ninit_scene_3.m\npid_control.m\nsiso_mpc_control.m\nsimo_mpc_control.m\n\nImages related to the scenarios can be found in the /report/img folder.

This feature is automatically enabled when using Vuforia or TFOD—no additional RC configuration is required for typical use cases. To hide the stream, select the same menu item again.\nNote that gamepads are disabled and the selected opmode cannot be started while the stream is open as a safety precaution.\nTo use custom streams, consult the API docs for CameraStreamServer#setSource and CameraStreamSource.\n\n\nAdds many Star Wars sounds to RobotController resources.\nAdded SKYSTONE Sounds Chooser Sample Program.\nSwitches out startup, connect chimes, and error/warning sounds for Star Wars sounds\nUpdates OnBot Java to use a WebSocket for communication with the robot\n\nThe OnBot Java page no longer has to do a full refresh when a user switches from editing one file to another\n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nCamera Stream\n\nThe Vuforia camera stream inherits the issues present in the phone preview (namely ftc_app issue #574). This problem does not affect the TFOD camera stream even though it receives frames from Vuforia.\nThe orientation of the stream frames may not always match the phone preview. For now, these frames may be rotated manually via a custom CameraStreamSource if desired.\n\n\nOnBotJava\n\nBrowser back button may not always work correctly\nIt\'s possible for a build to be queued, but not started. The OnBot Java build console will display a warning if this occurs.\nA user might not realize they are editing a different file if the user inadvertently switches from one file to another since this switch is now seamless.

recover.\nrobotControllerLog.txt would have error messages that included the words ""E RobotCore: lynx xmit lock: #### abandoning lock:""\n\n\nIncludes fix to correctly list the parent module address for a REV Robotics Expansion Hub in a configuration (.xml) file.\n\nBug in versions 4.0 and 4.1 would incorrect list the address module for a parent REV Robotics device as ""1"".\nIf the parent module had a higher address value than the daisy-chained module, then this bug would prevent the Robot Controller from communicating with the downstream Expansion Hub.\n\n\nAdded requirement for ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION to allow a Driver Station running Android Oreo to scan for Wi-Fi Direct devices.\nAdded google() repo to build.gradle because aapt2 must be downloaded from the google() repository beginning with version 3.2 of the Android Gradle Plugin.\n\nImportant Note: Android Studio users will need to be connected to the Internet the first time build the ftc_app project.\nInternet connectivity is required for the first build so the appropriate files can be downloaded from the Google repository.\nUsers should not need to be connected to the Internet for subsequent builds.\nThis should also fix buid issue where Android Studio would complain that it ""Could not find com.android.tools.lint:lint-gradle:26.1.4"" (or similar).\n\n\nAdded support for REV Spark Mini motor controller as part of the configuration menu for a servo/PWM port on the REV Expansion Hub.\nProvide examples for playing audio files in an Op Mode.\nBlock Development Tool

to determine the relative position of the gold block (left, center, right).\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.1 (released on 18.09.24)\nChanges include:\n\nFix to prevent crash when deprecated configuration annotations are used.\nChange to allow FTC Robot Controller APK to be auto-updated using FIRST Global Control Hub update scripts.\nRemoved samples for non supported / non legal hardware.\nImprovements to Telemetry.addData block with ""text"" socket.\nUpdated Blocks sample op mode list to include Rover Ruckus Vuforia example.\nUpdate SDK library version number.\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 4.0 (released on 18.09.12)\nChanges include:\n\n\nInitial support for UVC compatible cameras\n\nIf UVC camera has a unique serial number, RC will detect and enumerate by serial number.\nIf UVC camera lacks a unique serial number, RC will only support one camera of that type connected.\nCalibration settings for a few cameras are included (see TeamCode/src/main/res/xml/teamwebcamcalibrations.xml for details).\nUser can upload calibration files from Program and Manage web interface.\nUVC cameras seem to draw a fair amount of electrical current from the USB bus.\n\nThis does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n\n\n\n\nThis does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.\nFTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.\n\n\nUpdated sample Vuforia Navigation and VuMark Op Modes to demonstrate how to use an internal phone-based camera and an external UVC webcam.\n\n\n\nSupport for improved motor control.\n\nREV Robotics Expansion Hub firmware 1.8 and greater will support a feed forward mechanism for closed loop motor control.\nFTC SDK has been modified to support PIDF coefficients (proportional, integral, derivative, and feed forward).\nFTC Blocks development tool modified to include PIDF programming blocks.\nDeprecated older PID-related methods and variables.\nREV\'s 1.8.x PIDF-related changes provide a more linear and accurate way to control a motor.\n\n\n\nWireless\n\nAdded 5GHz support for wireless channel changing for those devices that support it.\n\nTested with Moto G5 and E4 phones.\n\n\n\n\nAlso tested with other (currently non-approved) phones such as Samsung Galaxy S8.\n\n\n\nImproved Expansion Hub firmware update support in Robot Controller app\n\nChanges to make the system more robust during the firmware update process (when performed through Robot Controller app).\nUser no longer has to disconnect a downstream daisy-chained Expansion Hub when updating an Expansion Hub\'s firmware.\n\nIf user is updating an Expansion Hub\'s firmware through a USB connection, he/she does not have to disconnect RS485 connection to other Expansion Hubs.\n\n\n\n\nThe user still must use a USB connection to update an Expansion Hub\'s firmware.\nThe user cannot update the Expansion Hub firmware for a downstream device that is daisy chained through an RS485 connection.\n\n\nIf an Expansion Hub accidentally gets ""bricked"" the Robot Controller app is now more likely to recognize the Hub when it scans the USB bus.\n\nRobot Controller app should be able to detect an Expansion Hub, even if it accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.\n\n\n\n\nRobot Controller app should be able to install the firmware onto the Hub, even if if accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.\n\n\n\nResiliency\n\nFTC software can detect and enable an FTDI reset feature that is available with REV Robotics v1.8 Expansion Hub firmware and greater.\n\nWhen enabled, the Expansion Hub can detect if it hasn\'t communicated with the Robot Controller over the FTDI (USB) connection.\n\n\n\n\nIf the Hub hasn\'t heard from the Robot Controller in a while, it will reset the FTDI connection.\nThis action helps system recover from some ESD-induced disruptions.\n\n\nVarious fixes to improve reliability of FTC software.\n\n\n\nBlocks\n\nFixed errors with string and list indices in blocks export to java.\nSupport for USB connected UVC webcams.\nRefactored optimized Blocks Vuforia code to support Rover Ruckus image targets.\nAdded programming blocks to support PIDF (proportional, integral, derivative and feed forward) motor control.\nAdded formatting options (under Telemetry and Miscellaneous categories) so user can set how many decimal places to display a numerical value.\nSupport to play audio files (which are uploaded through Blocks web interface) on Driver Station in addition to the Robot Controller.\nFixed bug with Download Image of Blocks feature.\nSupport for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\nSupport for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor.\nAdded support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device).\nAdded blocks for DcMotorEx methods.\n\nThese are enhanced methods that you can use when supported by the motor controller hardware.\n\n\n\n\nThe REV Robotics Expansion Hub supports these enhanced methods.\nEnhanced methods include methods to get/set motor velocity (in encoder pulses per second), get/set PIDF coefficients, etc..\n\n\n\nModest Improvements in Logging\n\nDecrease frequency of battery checker voltage statements.\nRemoved non-FTC related log statements (wherever possible).\nIntroduced a ""Match Logging"" feature.\n\nUnder ""Settings"" a user can enable/disable this feature (it\'s disabled by default).\n\n\n\n\nIf enabled, user provides a ""Match Number"" through the Driver Station user interface (top of the screen).\n\nThe Match Number is used to create a log file specifically with log statements from that particular Op Mode run.\nMatch log files are stored in /sdcard/FIRST/matlogs on the Robot Controller.\nOnce an op mode run is complete, the Match Number is cleared.\nThis is a convenient way to create a separate match log with statements only related to a specific op mode run.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Devices\n\nSupport for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\nSupport for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor.\nAdded configuration option for REV 20:1 HD Hex Motor.\nAdded support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device).\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFixed some errors in the definitions for acceleration and velocity in our javadoc documentation.\nAdded ability to play audio files on Driver Station\nWhen user is configuring an Expansion Hub, the LED on the Expansion Hub will change blink pattern (purple-cyan)  to indicate which Hub is currently being configured.\nRenamed I2cSensorType to I2cDeviceType.\nAdded an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates localization using 2018-2019 (Rover Ruckus presented by QualComm) Vuforia targets.\nAdded an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics 2m Laser Distance Sensor.\nAdded an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.\nRe-categorized external Java sample Op Modes to ""TeleOp"" instead of ""Autonomous"".\n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\n\nInitial support for UVC compatible cameras\n\nUVC cameras seem to draw significant amount of current from the USB bus.\n\nThis does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.\n\n\n\n\nThis does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.\nFTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.\n\n\nThere might be a possible deadlock which causes the RC to become unresponsive when using a UVC webcam with a Nougat Android Robot Controller.\n\n\n\nWireless\n\nWhen user selects a wireless channel, this channel does not necessarily persist if the phone is power cycled.\n\nTech Team is hoping to eventually address this issue in a future release.\n\n\n\n\nIssue has been present since apps were introduced (i.e., it is not new with the v4.0 release).\n\n\nWireless channel is not currently displayed for WiFi Direct connections.\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe blink indication feature that shows which Expansion Hub is currently being configured does not work for a newly created configuration file.\n\nUser has to first save a newly created configuration file and then close and re-edit the file in order for blink indicator to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 3.6 (built on 17.12.18)\nChanges include:\n\nBlocks Changes\n\nUses updated Google Blockly software to allow users to edit their op modes on Apple iOS devices (including iPad and iPhone).\nImprovement in Blocks tool to handle corrupt op mode files.\nAutonomous op modes should no longer get switched back to tele-op after re-opening them to be edited.\nThe system can now detect type mismatches during runtime and alert the user with a message on the Driver Station.\n\n\nUpdated javadoc documentation for setPower() method to reflect correct range of values (-1 to +1).\nModified VuforiaLocalizerImpl to allow for user rendering of frames\n\nAdded a user-overrideable onRenderFrame() method which gets called by the class\'s renderFrame() method.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Information\n\nVersion 3.5 (built on 17.10.30)\nChanges with version 3.5 include:\n\nIntroduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which can occur after the Robot Controller app has been paused and then resumed (for example, when a user temporarily turns off the display of the Robot Controller phone, and then turns the screen back on).\nIntroduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which were previously caused by random peer disconnect events on the Driver Station.\nFixes issue where log files would be closed on pause of the RC or DS, but not re-opened upon resume.\nFixes issue with battery handler (voltage) start/stop race.\nFixes issue where Android Studio generated op modes would disappear from available list in certain situations.\nFixes problem where OnBot Java would not build on REV Robotics Control Hub.\nFixes problem where OnBot Java would not build if the date and time on the Robot Controller device was ""rewound"" (set to an earlier date/time).\nImproved error message on OnBot Java that occurs when renaming a file fails.\nRemoved unneeded resources from android.jar binaries used by OnBot Java to reduce final size of Robot Controller app.\nAdded MR_ANALOG_TOUCH_SENSOR block to Blocks

Block op modes to be more consistent with Java samples.\nAdded some additional sample Block op modes.\nReworded OnBot Java readme slightly.\n\n\nVersion 3.3 (built on 17.09.04)\nThis version of the software includes improves for the FTC Blocks Programming Tool and the OnBot Java Programming Tool.\nChanges with verion 3.3 include:\n\nAndroid Studio ftc_app project has been updated to use Gradle Plugin 2.3.3.\nAndroid Studio ftc_app project is already using gradle 3.5 distribution.\nRobot Controller log has been renamed to /sdcard/RobotControllerLog.txt (note that this change was actually introduced w/ v3.2).\nImprovements in I2C reliability.\nOptimized I2C read for REV Expansion Hub, with v1.7 firmware or greater.\nUpdated all external/samples (available through OnBot and in Android project folder).\nVuforia\n\nAdded support for VuMarks that will be used for the 2017-2018 season game.\n\n\nBlocks\n\nUpdate to latest Google Blockly release.\nSample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode.\nFixed bug where the blocks would disappear temporarily when mouse button is held down.\nAdded blocks for Range.clip and Range.scale.\nUser can now disable/enable Block op modes.\nFix to prevent occasional Blocks deadlock.\n\n\nOnBot Java\n\nSignificant improvements with autocomplete function for OnBot Java editor.\nSample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode.\nFixes and changes to complete hardware setup feature.\nUpdated (and more useful) onBot welcome message.\n\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nAndroid Studio\n\nAfter updating to the new v3.3 Android Studio project folder, if you get error messages indicating ""InvalidVirtualFileAccessException"" then you might need to do a File->Invalidate Caches / Restart to clear the error.\n\n\nOnBot Java\n\nSometimes when you push the build button to build all op modes, the RC returns an error message that the build failed.  If you press the build button a second time, the build typically suceeds.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 3.2 (built on 17.08.02)\nThis version of the software introduces the ""OnBot Java"" Development Tool.  Similar to the FTC Blocks Development Tool, the FTC OnBot Java Development Tool allows a user to create, edit and build op modes dynamically using only a Javascript-enabled web browser.\nThe OnBot Java Development Tool is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is served up by the Robot Controller.  Op modes are created and edited using a Javascript-enabled browser (Google Chromse is recommended).  Op modes are saved on the Robot Controller Android device directly.\nThe OnBot Java Development Tool provides a Java programming environment that does NOT need Android Studio.\nChanges with version 3.2 include:\n\n\nEnhanced web-based development tools\n\nIntroduction of OnBot Java Development Tool.\nWeb-based programming and management features are ""always on"" (user no longer needs to put Robot Controller into programming mode).\nWeb-based management interface (where user can change Robot Controller name and also easily download Robot Controller log file).\nOnBot Java, Blocks and Management features available from web based interface.\n\n\n\nBlocks Programming Development Tool:\n\nChanged ""LynxI2cColorRangeSensor"" block to ""REV Color/range sensor"" block.\nFixed tooltip for ColorSensor.isLightOn block.\nAdded blocks for ColorSensor.getNormalizedColors and LynxI2cColorRangeSensor.getNormalizedColors.\n\n\n\nAdded example op modes for digital touch sensor and REV Robotics Color Distance sensor.\n\n\nUser selectable color themes.\n\n\nIncludes many minor enhancements and fixes (too numerous to list).\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\nAuto complete function is incomplete and does not support the following (for now):\n\nAccess via this keyword\nAccess via super keyword\nMembers of the super cloass, not overridden by the class\nAny methods provided in the current class\nInner classes\nCan\'t handle casted objects\nAny objects coming from an parenthetically enclosed expression\n\n\n\n\nVersion 3.10 (built on 17.05.09)\nThis version of the software provides support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub.  This version also includes improvements in the USB communication layer in an effort to enhance system resiliency.  If you were using a 2.x version of the software previously, updating to version 3.1 requires that you also update your Driver Station software in addition to updating the Robot Controller software.\nAlso note that in version 3.10 software, the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods are no longer available (not deprecated, they have been removed from the SDK). Also note that the the new 3.x software incorporates motor profiles that a user can select as he/she configures the robot.\nChanges include:\n\nBlocks changes\n\nAdded VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener.getPose and Vuforia.trackPose blocks.\nAdded optimized blocks support for Vuforia extended tracking.\nAdded atan2 block to the math category.\nAdded useCompetitionFieldTargetLocations parameter to Vuforia.initialize block.  If set to false, the target locations are placed at (0,0,0) with target orientation as specified in https://github.com/gearsincorg/FTCVuforiaDemo/blob/master/Robot_Navigation.java tutorial op mode.\n\n\nIncorporates additional improvements to USB comm layer to improve system resiliency (to recover from a greater number of communication disruptions).\n\n\nAdditional Notes Regarding Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)\nIn addition to the release changes listed below (see section labeled ""Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.013)""), version 3.00 has the following important changes:\n\nVersion 3.00 software uses a new version of the FTC Robocol (robot protocol).  If you upgrade to v3.0 on the Robot Controller and/or Android Studio side, you must also upgrade the Driver Station software to match the new Robocol.\nVersion 3.00 software removes the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods from the DcMotor class.  If you have an op mode that formerly used these methods, you will need to remove the references/calls to these methods.  Instead, v3.0 provides the max speed information through the use of motor profiles that are selected by the user during robot configuration.\nVersion 3.00 software currently does not have a mechanism to disable extra i2c sensors.  We hope to re-introduce this function with a release in the near future.\n\n\nVersion 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)\n*** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***\nThis software is being released as an ""alpha"" version.  Use this version at your own risk!\nThis pre-release software contains SIGNIFICANT changes, including changes to the Wi-Fi Direct pairing mechanism, rewrites of the I2C sensor classes, changes to the USB/FTDI layer, and the introduction of support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub and the REV Robotics color-range-light sensor.  These changes were implemented to improve the reliability and resiliency of the FTC control system.\nPlease note, however, that version 3.00 is considered ""alpha"" code.  This code is being released so that the FIRST community will have an opportunity to test the new REV Expansion Hub electronics module when it becomes available in May.  The developers do not recommend using this code for critical applications (i.e., competition use).\n*** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***\nChanges include:\n\nMajor rework of sensor-related infrastructure.

This is important - we no longer set the motor modes through the motor controller.\nsetMode and getMode were added to the DcMotor class.\nContinuousRotationServo class has been added to the FTC SDK.\nRange.clip() method has been overloaded so it can support this operation for int, short and byte integers.\nSome changes have been made (new methods added) on how a user can access items from the hardware map.\nUsers can now set the zero power behavior for a DC motor so that the motor will brake or float when power is zero.\nPrototype Blockly Programming Mode has been added to FTC Robot Controller.  Users can place the Robot Controller into this mode, and then use a device (such as a laptop) that has a Javascript enabled browser to write Blockly-based Op Modes directly onto the Robot Controller.\nUsers can now configure the robot remotely through the FTC Driver Station app.\nAndroid Studio project supports Android Studio 2.1.x and compile SDK Version 23 (Marshmallow).\nVuforia Computer Vision SDK integrated into FTC SDK.  Users can use sample vision targets to get localization information on a standard FTC field.\nProject structure has been reorganized so that there is now a TeamCode package that users can use to place their local/custom Op Modes into this package.\nInspection function has been integrated into the FTC Robot Controller and Driver Station Apps (Thanks Team HazMat… 9277 & 10650!).\nAudio cues have been incorporated into FTC SDK.\nSwap mechanism added to FTC Robot Controller configuration activity.  For example, if you have two motor controllers on a robot, and you misidentified them in your configuration file, you can use the Swap button to swap the devices within the configuration file (so you do not have to manually re-enter in the configuration info for the two devices).\nFix mechanism added to all user to replace an electronic module easily.  For example, suppose a servo controller dies on your robot. You replace the broken module with a new module, which has a different serial number from the original servo controller.  You can use the Fix button to automatically reconfigure your configuration file to use the serial number of the new module.\nImprovements made to fix resiliency and responsiveness of the system.\nFor LinearOpMode the user now must for a telemetry.update() to update the telemetry data on the driver station.  This update() mechanism ensures that the driver station gets the updated data properly and at the same time.\nThe Auto Configure function of the Robot Controller is now template based.  If there is a commonly used robot configuration, a template can be created so that the Auto Configure mechanism can be used to quickly configure a robot of this type.\nThe logic to detect a runaway op mode (both in the LinearOpMode and OpMode types) and to abort the run, then auto recover has been improved/implemented.\nFix has been incorporated so that Logitech F310 gamepad mappings will be correct for Marshmallow users.\n\n\nRelease 16.07.08\n\nFor the ftc_app project, the gradle files have been modified to support Android Studio 2.1.x.\n\n\nRelease 16.03.30\n\nFor the MIT App Inventor, the design blocks have new icons that better represent the function of each design component.\nSome changes were made to the shutdown logic to ensure the robust shutdown of some of our USB services.\nA change was made to LinearOpMode so as to allow a given instance to be executed more than once, which is required for the App Inventor.\nJavadoc improved/updated.\n\n\nRelease 16.03.09\n\nChanges made to make the FTC SDK synchronous (significant change!)\n\nwaitOneFullHardwareCycle() and waitForNextHardwareCycle() are no longer needed and have been deprecated.\nrunOpMode() (for a LinearOpMode) is now decoupled from the system\'s hardware read/write thread.\nloop() (for an OpMode) is now decoupled from the system\'s hardware read/write thread.\nMethods are synchronous.\nFor example, if you call setMode(DcMotorController.RunMode.RESET_ENCODERS) for a motor, the encoder is guaranteed to be reset when the method call is complete.\nFor legacy module (NXT compatible), user no longer has to toggle between read and write modes when reading from or writing to a legacy device.\n\n\nChanges made to enhance reliability/robustness during ESD event.\nChanges made to make code thread safe.\nDebug keystore added so that user-generated robot controller APKs will all use the same signed key (to avoid conflicts if a team has multiple developer laptops for example).\nFirmware version information for Modern Robotics modules are now logged.\nChanges made to improve USB comm reliability and robustness.\nAdded support for voltage indicator for legacy (NXT-compatible) motor controllers.\nChanges made to provide auto stop capabilities for op modes.\n\nA LinearOpMode class will stop when the statements in runOpMode() are complete.  User does not have to push the stop button on the driver station.\nIf an op mode is stopped by the driver station, but there is a run away/uninterruptible thread persisting, the app will log an error message then force itself to crash to stop the runaway thread.\n\n\nDriver Station UI modified to display lowest measured voltage below current voltage (12V battery).\nDriver Station UI modified to have color background for current voltage (green=good, yellow=caution, red=danger, extremely low voltage).\njavadoc improved (edits and additional classes).\nAdded app build time to About activity for driver station and robot controller apps.\nDisplay local IP addresses on Driver Station About activity.\nAdded I2cDeviceSynchImpl.\nAdded I2cDeviceSync interface.\nAdded seconds() and milliseconds() to ElapsedTime for clarity.\nAdded getCallbackCount() to I2cDevice.\nAdded missing clearI2cPortActionFlag.\nAdded code to create log messages while waiting for LinearOpMode shutdown.\nFix so Wifi Direct Config activity will no longer launch multiple times.\nAdded the ability to specify an alternate i2c address in software for the Modern Robotics gyro.\n\n\nRelease 16.02.09\n\nImproved battery checker feature so that voltage values get refreshed regularly (every 250 msec) on Driver Station (DS) user interface.\nImproved software so that Robot Controller (RC) is much more resilient and “self-healing” to USB disconnects:\n\nIf user attempts to start/restart RC with one or more module missing, it will display a warning but still start up.\nWhen running an op mode, if one or more modules gets disconnected, the RC & DS will display warnings,and robot will keep on working in spite of the missing module(s).\nIf a disconnected module gets physically reconnected the RC will auto detect the module and the user will regain control of the recently connected module.\nWarning messages are more helpful (identifies the type of module that’s missing plus its USB serial number).\n\n\nCode changes to fix the null gamepad reference when users try to reference the gamepads in the init() portion of their op mode.\nNXT light sensor output is now properly scaled.  Note that teams might have to readjust their light threshold values in their op modes.\nOn DS user interface, gamepad icon for a driver will disappear if the matching gamepad is disconnected or if that gamepad gets designated as a different driver.\nRobot Protocol (ROBOCOL) version number info is displayed in About screen on RC and DS apps.\nIncorporated a display filter on pairing screen to filter out devices that don’t use the “-“ format. This filter can be turned off to show all WiFi Direct devices.\nUpdated text in License file.\nFixed formatting error in OpticalDistanceSensor.toString().\nFixed issue on with a blank (“”) device name that would disrupt WiFi Direct Pairing.\nMade a change so that the WiFi info and battery info can be displayed more quickly on the DS upon connecting to RC.\nImproved javadoc generation.\nModified code to make it easier to support language localization in the future.\n\n\nRelease 16.01.04\n\nUpdated compileSdkVersion for apps\nPrevent Wifi from entering power saving mode\nremoved unused import from driver station\nCorrrected ""Dead zone"" joystick code.\nLED.getDeviceName and .getConnectionInfo() return null\napps check for ROBOCOL_VERSION mismatch\nFix for Telemetry also has off-by-one errors in its data string sizing / short size limitations error\nUser telemetry output is sorted.\nadded formatting variants to DbgLog and RobotLog APIs\ncode modified to allow for a long list of op mode names.\nchanges to improve thread safety of RobocolDatagramSocket\nFix for ""missing hardware leaves robot controller disconnected from driver station"" error\nfix for ""fast tapping of Init/Start causes problems"" (toast is now only instantiated on UI thread).\nadded some log statements for thread life cycle.\nmoved gamepad reset logic inside of initActiveOpMode() for robustness\nchanges made to mitigate risk of race conditions on public methods.\nchanges to try and flag when WiFi Direct name contains non-printable characters.\nfix to correct race condition between .run() and .close() in ReadWriteRunnableStandard.\nupdated FTDI driver\nmade ReadWriteRunnableStanard interface public.\nfixed off-by-one errors in Command constructor\nmoved specific hardware implmentations into their own package.\nmoved specific gamepad implemnatations to the hardware library.\nchanged LICENSE file to new BSD version.\nfixed race condition when shutting down Modern Robotics USB devices.\nmethods in the ColorSensor classes have been synchronized.\ncorrected isBusy() status to reflect end of motion.\ncorrected ""back"" button keycode.\nthe notSupported() method of the GyroSensor class was changed to protected (it should not be public).\n\n\nRelease 15.11.04.001\n\nAdded Support for Modern Robotics Gyro.\n\n\nThe GyroSensor class now supports the MR Gyro Sensor.\nUsers can access heading data (about Z axis)\nUsers can also access raw gyro data (X, Y, & Z axes).\nExample MRGyroTest.java op mode included.\n\n\nImproved error messages\n\n\nMore descriptive error messages for exceptions in user code.\n\n\nUpdated DcMotor API\nEnable read mode on new address in setI2cAddress\nFix so that driver station app resets the gamepads when switching op modes.\nUSB-related code changes to make USB comm more responsive and to display more explicit error messages.\n\n\nFix so that USB will recover properly if the USB bus returns garbage data.\nFix USB initializtion race condition.\nBetter error reporting during FTDI open.\nMore explicit messages during USB failures.\nFixed bug so that USB device is closed if event loop teardown method was not called.\n\n\nFixed timer UI issue\nFixed duplicate name UI bug (Legacy Module configuration).\nFixed race condition in EventLoopManager.\nFix to keep references stable when updating gamepad.\nFor legacy Matrix motor/servo controllers removed necessity of appending ""Motor"" and ""Servo"" to controller names.\nUpdated HT color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbLegacyModule class.\nUpdated MR color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbDeviceInterfaceModule class.\nCorrectly handle I2C Address change in all color sensors\nUpdated/cleaned up op modes.\n\n\nUpdated comments in LinearI2cAddressChange.java example op mode.\nReplaced the calls to ""setChannelMode"" with ""setMode"" (to match the new of the DcMotor  method).\nRemoved K9AutoTime.java op mode.\nAdded MRGyroTest.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Gyro Sensor).\nAdded MRRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Color Sensor).\nAdded HTRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use HT legacy color sensor).\nAdded MatrixControllerDemo.java (demonstrates how to use legacy Matrix controller).\n\n\nUpdated javadoc documentation.\nUpdated release .apk files for Robot Controller and Driver Station apps.\n\nT.

The goal is to automate the entire ML process (feature-engineering, training, prediction).\nThis version of the app is optimized for loading data files to train with, and test files for predictions. Prediction files are optimized for submission in Kaggle competitions. Currently, we only support Machine Learning classification problems. The Machine Learning component is based upon mlLib, a library that I created, put into code techniques I have learning during my ML studies.\nMy motivation for RobotClassify centers around my interest in making machine learning accessible for citizen developers. Taking the complicated task of feature engineering, model selection, and training and making it a simple point and click exercise without any prior machine learning training.\nUsing RobotClassify requires four simple steps that can all be accomplished via the RobotClassify.herokuapp.com.\n\nLoad a CSV data file. This is done by creating a project and specifying the training and test files (examples are found in the examples folder)\nCreate a Run. The run record defines the file attributes and the nature of the training. For this, we need to specify:\n\nThe target variable that is to be predicted\nRecord Key column\nPredict set out. These are the columns that are used to create the predict file in a format that can be used to submit the test results in a Kaggle competition\nClassification model to train\nScoring method\nAlgorithm type (There are two approaches used to automate feature engineering)\n\n\nRun the training\nReview the results\n\nRunning and Testing Instructions\nRobotClassify can be accessed from the URL: https://robotclassify.herokuapp.com/.\nRunning on the Web\nThe web interface provides a 4 step approach to completing training and getting a result:\n\nLoad the training and test files by creating a project\nCreate a run record. The run record describes the test attributes\nRun the training\nDownload the results file from the predictions\n\nFor example, the Titanic Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) provides two data sets, the training set and a test set. Loading these into RobotClassify, we would set the run parameters as follows:\n\nTarget Variable: Survived\nRecord Key: PassengerID\nPredict set out: Survived, PassengerID\nClassification model: xgbc\nScoring method: f1\nUse Algorithm I for feature engineering: True\n\nFollowing these instructions will give a training result that would put you in the top 8% of competitors.\nImplementation Overview\nThe application was written with Flask as the backend and Flask What-the-forms for the frontend.\nRoles\nDISABLED FOR NOW - ALL PERMISSIONS AVAILABLE FOR ALL USERS.fit\nThere are two roles:\n\nViewer Role: Viewers can only view projects, runs, and their results.\nEditor Role: Editors can create projects, runs, and perform training\n\n\n\n\npermissions\nEditor\nViewer\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nget:project\nYes\nYes\nget a single, or list of projects\n\n\npost:project\nYes\n\nCreate a new project or search\n\n\npatch:project\nYes\n\nUpdate a project attributes\n\n\ndelete:project\nYes\n\nDelete a project and its runs\n\n\nget:run\nYes\nYes\nGet a run or download run results\n\n\npost:run\nYes\n\nCreate a new run\n\n\npatch:run\nYes\n\nUpdate a run\'s attributes\n\n\ndelete:run\nYes\n\nDelete a run\n\n\nget:train\nYes\n\nRun ML Training\n\n\n\nAPI End Points\nThe following APIs endpoints are available.

There are 2 nodes in the project. `\n\ndrive_bot\nprocess_image\n\nROS Node\ndrive_bot\nThis server node provides a ball_chaser/command_robot service to drive the robot around by setting its linear x and angular z velocities. The service server publishes messages containing the velocities for the wheel joints.\nprocess_image\nThis client node will subscribe to the robot’s camera images and analyze them to determine the position of the white ball. Once the ball position is determined, the client node will request a service from the drive_bot server node to drive the robot toward the ball. The robot can drive either left, right or forward, depending on the robot position inside the image.\nHere, a simple approach is used. First, search for white pixels inside the array image. Since the ball is the only object in the world that is white, white pixels indicate the ball’s presence. Then, once you find that the ball, identify its position with respect to the camera - either the left, middle, or right side of the image.\nProject Environment\nTo get start with the project environment, run the following:\n$ cd RoboND-Ball-Chaser-Robot/catkin_ws\n$ catkin_make\n$ source devel/setup.bash\n$ roslaunch my_robot world.launch\n\nThen, setup RViz to visualize the sensor readings.

I think the software could work, but there are 2 major hardware problems.\nThe ultrasonic sensor is not anywhere near accurate enough, and it will probably work a lot better if I can have more than one point (currently I only have the distance to the first obstacle in front of the robot). A lidar could work well for that.\nThe second problem is the accuracy of the positioning system. This version doesn\'t have any feedback, it only knows when and for how much time the motors where powered. It works pretty well for the first few seconds but quickly desynchronizes from reality. I should add encoders on the wheels.\nAlso the communication between the Arduino and the ESP and between the ESP and the phone are slow, I should try to improve on that (Maybe use TCP instead of HTTP for the ESP-phone).\nLastly, the Arduino is a bit underpowered to calculate paths, even with A* pathfinding. I can maybe replace it with a Teensy or use the ESP or a Raspberry pi for these high level things.\nDemo\nThis project is a robot that uses an ultrasonic sensor and an Arduino to create a 2D map of its environment. It is then able to use this 2D map to move from one point to another using pathfinding. To be controlled, the robot\'s ESP8266 hosts a Wifi network that the user can connect to using a smartphone app. The app requests and displays the 2D map of the robot and its expected position in the map. The user can then click on the place he wants the robot to move to.\nFor the moment the obstacle avoiding doesn\'t work and the map updating is really bad. But I managed to get the communication and the navigation working so I made this short demo video\n\nHow does this work\nSoftware used:\nFor the ESP and Arduino programs: The Arduino IDE\nFor the smartphone app: Android Studio\nFor the model: Blender and PrusaSlicer\nI used an Arduino Mega+Wifi which is an Arduino Mega with an ESP8266 integrated. But the project is designed to work on an Arduino Uno with a separate ESP module (Thats what I wanted to do in the beginning but I used the Mega+Wifi for simplicity). So the control program is designed to work with only 10 digital pins and only 2048 bytes of dynamic memory.\nEnvironment map\nAt each navigation update, the last distance recorded by the ultrasonic sensor is used to update the main map (if there has been a measure since the last update). All the pixels between the position of the robot and hit point are turned off and the pixel on the hit point is turned on.\nThe main map is 72 by 72 pixels. If each pixel was stored in one byte, it would take 5184 bytes which is 2.5 times the max memory of the Uno. So I made an utility file to manage boolean matrices. What it does is simply use all the bits it has, by storing 8 booleans on each byte. With that solution the space used by the main map drops to 649 bytes.\nThere is also a second map, in lower resolution (24*24) but with numbers (unsigned char) instead of booleans and used only for the pathfinding. This map is updated at the same time as the main map, but following a different rule: Each pixel on this map is turned on if there is at least one pixel that is on in the 5x5 square at the corresponding position in the main map. For example the pixel at (5,5) in the low res map will check all the pixel between (5*3 -1, 5*3 -1) and (5*3 +3, 5*3+3) in the main map.\nThe sonar launches a measure every 25 milliseconds minimum (23 ms = 4 meters round trip for sound). When it starts a measure, it will just send a sound wave. Then, when the echo of the sound wave is received, the sensor will send a signal on the echo pin. The echo pin has a PCINT set up, so when the signal is received, the Arduino stops everything and calls a function. This function simply calculates the distance based on the time the sound wave took to go back to the sensor.\nNavigation\nThe memory space is very limited, so I had to find a pathfinding algorithm that works directly on the low res map (without storing too much things beside). The solution I came up with is not good in terms of performance but it meets this goal. The algorithm goes through the map and for each pixel, if a neighbour pixel has a distance value that is less or equal to its own distance value, it takes the neighbours pixel\'s value+1. And the algorithm does it repeatedly until there is no more change. The worst case scenario\'s complexity is n^2, but in practise it is often much faster because a lot of pixels are updated on each iteration. Also the order of the update changes between each iteration to maximise the chances of updating multiple pixels per iteration.\nNote: I added A* pathfinding to improve performance but it only works on the Mega because the Uno doesn\'t have enough memory\nAfter execution of this algorithm, the low res map will have 0 on the target position, 255 on the walls and the distance to the target on every other pixel. The low res map is then used by the robot to know in which direction it has to move. It finds the pixel that has the lowest value around him and goes towards it.\nTo keep track of the position of the robot on the map the control algorithm has to simulate the motors. I filmed the robot during an acceleration (using SpeedCalc.ino) and then I used Avimeca (old french software) and Excel to get the speed of the robot as a function of time. I found that it accelerates linearly for the first 0.7 seconds and then goes at constant speed. So I programmed this in the PositionTracker to increase its accuracy. I also added a waiting time every time the robot changes direction to reduce inaccuracies due to residual movement.\nControl\nThe goal of the communication part is too make the arduino exchange data with the smartphone app.\nThe arduino itself doesn\'t have a direct access to a wifi antenna, so we need to put an intermediary: the ESP8266. On the Mega+Wifi it is already on the board, but it is still a separated thing. To make it communicate with the Arduino we have to use Serial communication.\nSo the ESP8266 hosts a webserver and a wifi network. The smartphone app can then connect to this wifi network and send HTTP requests to the web server. The ESP will receive those requests and use Serial to ask the Arduino for an answer, and send back the answer to the phone via wifi.\nThe ESP server can respond to 3 requests:\n\n/map: Returns the intern map stored on the Arduino in the form of hexadecimal digits (one digit for 4 pixels)\n/set_target?x=000&y=000: Changes the goal location of the robot\n/position: Returns the expected position and rotation of the robot in its intern map.\n\nThe smartphone app is fairly simple. It keeps a copy of the robot\'s map and its position in memory and dislpays it to the user. At regular intervals, it sends a position and a map request to update it. If the user clicks on the screen, it will send a set_target request with the location where the user clicked. The requests are sent with a librairy called Volley.\nWhen the ESP receives the request, it will check for errors and then send a ""command"" via Serial to the Arduino. The commands that can be sent are M to get the map, P to get the position and T<x>,<y> to change the target. All the messages exchanged via Serial end by a \\n.\nIf the request is a set_target the response to the HTTP request will just be ""Target changed"" but if it is a map or a position request the ESP will record everything the Arduino sends via Serial until it finds a \\n, and then send the recorded message as a response.\nThe Arduino is constantly listening for requests from the ESP. When it receives a request, it responds immediatly. The only important thing to note is that the writing Serial buffer is limited in size (256 bytes for the Mega I think), and the answer to a map request takes 1296+1 bytes. The solution to this problem is to make the ESP read as the Arduino writes. I even added a security in case the Arduino writes faster than the ESP can read: The Arduino writes blocks of 16 bytes and then calls flush to wait for the ESP to finish reading the current block.\nReproduce this project\nThe way I did it\nYou will need:\n\n1 Arduino Mega with ESP module integrated\n1 OSOYOO Model X motors controller\n2 DC 3V-12V dual axis gear reducer motors (the yellow ones)\n1 HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor (with support, or you will have to print it)\n1 Hammer wheel\n8 1.5V batteries with a 8 slots support or two 4 slots supports\n1 Switch\n22 M2 bolts with nuts (I used 12 mm but 8 mm is enough)\nAn access to a 3D printer\n\nIf you also want to make the bonus (esthetics) part:\n\nAn SG90 servo motor\n\n3D Printing and Assembling\nIf you want to 3D print the robot you can use the 3D files in Models/. The parts in Body/ are the minimum you need to print to get the robot working. The parts in Esthetics/ are only esthetic. Thanks to Saban for the model I used for the WALL-E parts https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-wall-e-3971. You can find printing recommendations in the Models/Info/Recommendations.txt file.\nThe assembly is pretty hard but if you have patience and method it\'s doable. I recommend using a screwdriver and touching the motors with it to magnetise it so you can place bolts and nuts in the right place without too much effort.\nThe 4 holes in line on the front are for the sonar. You will only use 2 but if you use an Arduino Mega you will have to use the holes that are not in the middle (you can use the ones in the middle if you use an UNO).\nWhen placing the servo in the main box of the esthetic part, place it on the left of the supports. If you place it wrong the short arm will be too short and the long arm will be too long.\nSoftware upload\nFirst you will need to measure the robots speed. Upload the Tests/SpeedCalc/SpeedCalc.ino program in the Arduino. The robot will go forward for 3 seconds, then backwards for 3 seconds, then turn to the left for 3 seconds and turn to the right for 3 seconds. Make sure it does it in the right order. If it doesn\'t, invert the + and the - of the motors. Measure the distances the robot travels and the angles it makes when it turns. Then open ArduinoProgram/Data.h and put the values you found for the speed and angular speed (pay attention to the units).\nWhen this is done you just have to upload the code to the Arduino and the ESP.\nTo upload the code to the Arduino:\nOn the Mega, set the switches 3 and 4 to ON, all the rest to OFF (connects the Arduino to the USB port)\nIn Sketch > Include Library > Manage Librairies, install PinChangeInterrupt by NicoHood\nMake sure you selected the right board in Tools/Board.\nTo upload the code to the ESP:\nIn File > Preferences > Additionnal Boards Manager URLS, put this: https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json\nIn Tools > Board > Boards Manager, install esp8266 by ESP8266 Community\nOn the Mega, set the switches 5, 6 and 7 to ON, all the rest to OFF (connects the ESP to the USB port, in firmware update mode)\nMake sure you selected the Generic ESP8266 module.\nTo make it run you have to set the switches 1 and 2 to ON (you can leave the 3 and 4 also ON to be able to reupload code to the Arduino without changing the switches).\nPhone app\nIt is probably possible to transfer an apk or something to your phone to install the app but I don\'t know how to do it.\nTo install the app I used Android studio. Open the ControlApp folder with android studio, plug your phone to your computer via USB (you have to activate developper mode on your phone), and press the run button. It will transfer all the necessary data to your phone and launch the app. For the next launches you don\'t need the computer anymore.\nPossible changes\nYou can replace the Mega+ESP board with a regular Mega or an Uno board with a separate ESP module. That\'s what I wanted to do at the beginning, but I didn\'t manage to upload code to the ESP with this technique (I tried to plug it to the PC with a USB adapter, and I also tried to connect it to the arduino in serial and connect the arduino to the PC. Both methods without success). If you use an Arduino Uno you will have to use the old pathfinding algorithm because the Uno doesn\'t have enough memory to use the A* algorithm.\nThe control algorithm works on the Mega+Wifi and is supposed to work on the normal Mega and on the Uno without changing the pin numbers. If you want to change anything, go to ArduinoProgram/Data.h. If you want to use a separate ESP module, you might also have to change the Serial connection to the ESP on the Arduino side. Go to ArduinoProgram/Communication.cpp and change the SERIALOBJECT.\nThe holes in the robot\'s body can be used for an Uno or a Mega (and maybe some other board but they work for these ones).\nYou can replace the motors controller by another motors controller, it is not that important. But the holes in the robot models were made for this board so you might have to change them. The motors can be any type of motors but again, you might have to change the motors support model if you want to 3D print it. Just make sure they can endure 12V and they don\'t turn too fast.\nThe free wheel can be anything but you might have to modify the model so the front is at the same height as the back. It is important for the sonar (but if it is simpler for you, you can also change its angle).\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/KubbyDev', 'info_list': ['1', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 7, 2020', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'Java', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 5, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'C++', 'Updated Aug 21, 2020', 'Makefile', 'Updated Oct 13, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['Lidar-Controller\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/UA-NASA-Robotics', 'info_list': ['1', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 4, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 7, 2020', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'Java', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 2, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Feb 5, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Dec 31, 2019', 'C++', 'Updated Aug 21, 2020', 'Makefile', 'Updated Oct 13, 2020']}"
