Hierarchial algorithms will fail on other environments currently because of the calls to env.visualise_subgoal.\nThis repository uses RL algorithms which are modularized versions of OpenAI's spinning up implementations to explore hierarchial RL. I found that they were excellent for extending to new algorithms. The code is split into models, rollout functions and replay buffers. Models expose their actor to the rollout function, which transfers episodes to the replay buffer for saving. Models then sample from the replay buffer.\nThis made HER extremely easy, as it was just a replay buffer modification. It also made hierarchy easy to implement, as it only required a new rollout function which used two models and two replay buffers.\nTo run Soft Actor Critic on an environment,\npython SAC.py --env []\nTo load saved weights, use --load True, which will load from the same --exp_name.\nOther algorithms are HER.py (using SAC), TD3.py, hierarchy.py (based on Levy et al's Hierarchial Actor Critic). All follow the same interface as SAC.\nOnce you have trained a model, you can use collect_expert.py to collect --n_steps on --env using the model loaded with --exp_name.\nYou can then explore behavioural cloning with a command like\npython BC.py --filepath collected_data/20000HER2_pointMassObject-v0_Hidden_256l_2.npz --env pointMassObject-v0\nSimilarly, relay learning is run like this\npython relay_learning.py --filepath collected_data/20000HER2_pointMassObject-v0_Hidden_256l_2.npz --env pointMassObject-v0\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/sholtodouglas', 'info_list': ['7', 'Python', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jul 24, 2020', '3', 'Python', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 17, 2020', '3', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 8, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 14, 2020', 'Kotlin', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Jun 13, 2020', 'Updated Jan 10, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'Updated Jan 9, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['AMES2019\nHusky Robotics AMES game code for 2019\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Team4585', 'info_list': ['7', 'Python', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jul 24, 2020', '3', 'Python', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 17, 2020', '3', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 8, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 14, 2020', 'Kotlin', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Jun 13, 2020', 'Updated Jan 10, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'Updated Jan 9, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': [""2020 Robot Code\nCode for FRC 2036 Black Knights' 2020 Infinite Recharge robot.\nBuilding\nThis project uses gradle as its build system.

Vim + clangd is an alternative\nthat provides better intellisense because it actually invokes a C++ compiler\nfrontend. It also generates linting annotations via clang-tidy. Setup is as\nfollows.\n\nInstall Node.js. You should have a node executable in PATH.\nInstall clangd, which comes with the\nLLVM compiler\nAdd Plugin \'neoclide/coc.nvim\' to your .vimrc\nIn vim, run :CocInstall coc-clangd\nRun ./gradlew intellisense\n\nThe clangd indexer will start when a file is opened in Vim. See\nhttps://github.com/clangd/coc-clangd for troubleshooting steps if needed.\nBuild options\nBuild everything\n\n./gradlew build\n\nThis runs a roboRIO and desktop build and runs the desktop tests. This may take\na while, so more specific builds (see below) are recommended instead.\nBuild (athena)\n\n./gradlew buildAthena\n\nThis runs a roboRIO build.\nDeploy\n\n./gradlew deploy\n\nThis runs a roboRIO build if needed, copies the resulting binary to a roboRIO at\n10.35.12.2, and restarts it.\nTest\nUnit tests are useful for ensuring parts of the robot code continue to work\ncorrectly after implementing new features or refactoring existing functionality.\n\n./gradlew test\n\nThis runs a release build of the robot code\'s unit tests from src/test. This\nis a shorthand for the testRelease task.\n\n./gradlew testDebug\n\nThis runs a debug build of the robot code\'s unit tests from src/test.\n\n./gradlew testRelease\n\nThis runs a release build of the robot code\'s unit tests from src/test.\nSimulation GUI\n\n./gradlew simulateCpp\n\nThis runs a debug build of the robot code in the simulation GUI.\nDocumentation\n\n./gradlew doxygen\n\nThe source code and algorithms documentation is located in the docs\nfolder. This command generates HTML documentation for the robot code from\nin-source Doxygen comments. The results are placed in a docs/html folder with\nan index.html page as the root.\nGNU debugger (GDB)\n\n./buildscripts/gdb_test.py\n\nThis runs a debug build of the tests in GDB. Once the build completes and GDB\'s\nprompt appears, enter run to start the robot program. It may take a while due\nto the debugger having to load a lot of symbols.

This year, the autonomous period returns and is the standard 15 seconds. Teams earn points in this period from moving off the initiation line and earn double the usual points for scoring in the power cell goals. Tele-op adds access to the control panel, which can be spun 3 to 5 times once the stage 2 capacity has been reached for more points, and can spun to a specified color from the FMS to score more points and earn the alliance a ranking point. Endgame tasks robots to climb a ""generator switch"" square truss, which may swing to be balanced or unbalanced. A ranking point is given if three robots are able to climb, or if two robots climb and the shield generator is balanced.\nUnique features\nThis years robot\'s unique features include:\n\nAugmented state-space drivetrain controller\nVectored intake/outtake wheels\nFunnel\nIndexing conveyor\nTurret\nSingle-wheel flywheel (similar to 2012)\nTwo-stage elevator climbing system\nRaspberry Pi 3 w/ vision processing\n\nGoals of the year\n\n\n\nStatus\nGoal\nAdditional Description\n\n\n\n\nYes\nDrivetrain State-Space Controller\nFollowing set autonomous trajectories accurately and precisely and using a nonlinear observer for a global pose estimate.\n\n\nYes\nTurret State-Space Controller\nAutoaiming at at the goal while the drivetrain moves underneath.\n\n\nYes\nFlywheel State-Space Controller\nMaintaining a constant RPM with reasonable recovery time.\n\n\nYes\nComputer Vision\nUsing Perspective-n-Point to correct nonlinear observer\'s state estimate.\n\n\nYes\nUnit Tests\nSimulations for everything to test complicated robot code with no physical robot present.\n\n\n\nRoster\nMentors: Tyler Veness\nStudents: William Jin (Lead), Kyle Quinlan, Matthew Santana, Ivy Quach, Adan Silva\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/frc3512', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 10, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', '6', 'Kotlin', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Mar 3, 2021', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 25, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', '3', 'Java', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Jun 9, 2020', '5', 'C++', 'Updated Mar 5, 2021', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'C++', 'MIT license', 'Updated Sep 6, 2020', 'Updated Feb 29, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '53 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Gmartinica', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 10, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', '6', 'Kotlin', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Mar 3, 2021', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 25, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', '3', 'Java', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Jun 9, 2020', '5', 'C++', 'Updated Mar 5, 2021', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'C++', 'MIT license', 'Updated Sep 6, 2020', 'Updated Feb 29, 2020']}","{'location': 'San Jose CA', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '314 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['RoboticsLibs\nESP32 Helper Libraries\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/william-redenbaugh', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 10, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', '6', 'Kotlin', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Mar 3, 2021', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 25, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', '3', 'Java', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Jun 9, 2020', '5', 'C++', 'Updated Mar 5, 2021', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'C++', 'MIT license', 'Updated Sep 6, 2020', 'Updated Feb 29, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '1 contribution\n        in the last year', 'description': ['ååçå·¥å¤§å­¦å¹¿å·å­¦é¢æºå¨äººå·¥ç¨å­¦é¢\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/dengdqdq', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 10, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', '6', 'Kotlin', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Mar 3, 2021', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Jan 25, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', '3', 'Java', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Jun 9, 2020', '5', 'C++', 'Updated Mar 5, 2021', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'C++', 'MIT license', 'Updated Sep 6, 2020', 'Updated Feb 29, 2020']}"

Many developments of robots in this era center around robotâs ability to operate in conditions that are hazardous to their human operators. Though the ultimate goal might be to achieve full robot autonomy, there are still a number of steps necessary to achieve robots that can perform even the most basic human tasks without any input from a human operator. In order to advance the capabilities of a standard SMP robot base, this team sought to develop a teleoperated system capable of remotely travelling to a target object and performing visual analysis on this object. This research was completed as a simulation and precursor to Challenge 2 of the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge, which seeks to integrate aerial and terrestrial robotics in order to simulate potential urban disaster relief.\n\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/RuihaoW', 'info_list': ['3', 'Java', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Nov 5, 2020', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 21, 2020', '1', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', '1', 'Updated Feb 19, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 28, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '4 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Robotics project for ISR lab at UNIVAQ Italy\nContent:\n\nDescription\nRequirements\nInstallation and run\nFile structure\nRobots\nAI\nProlog\nResults\n\nDescription\nThis is project made as final project for ISR lab. The task of the robot\nis to navigate through field, detect obstacle, map the field and find a\nred spot somewhere in the field. Example of the field can be seen in\nFigure below and the whole assignment is described in Assigment PDF.\nDetailed final description and results can be found in report.pdf.\n\nRequirements\n\nPython3.5+ and basic libraries + NumPy, PyGame\nVREP simulator\nVREP api - If you have\nalready installed this API from AAAI-DISIM-UnivAQ fork, you have to\ndownload it again, as we added support for touch button.\nSWI Prolog interpreter\nPySwip\nLego EV3 robot with Debian linux from EV3DEV\nOdometrium\n\nInstallation\nJust install all requirements from Requirements section.\nFor simulated robot robot:\n\nrun VREP simulator\nload scene.ttt\nrun main_vrep.py\n\nwindow with PyGame should appear and robot should start to move\n\n\n\nFor real robot:\n\nConnect to the robot with tutorials at EV3Dev\nUpload files to robot\nCreate a field similar to image in Description\nChange field size in main_robot.py\nrun main_robot.py\n\nFile structure\nFiles are structured in folders, corresponding to their purpose.\nFolders:\n\nMain folder - includes files with AI of the robots,\none file (main_vrep.py) for the simulated robot and\nsecond file (main_robot.py) for the real lego robot.\nrobots - includes class for the robot, again\none (lego_robot_vrep.py) for the\nsimulated robot and second one (lego_robot.py)\nfor the real robot\nprolog - includes prolog .pl\nfile, which includes the logic for robot behaviour in the field.\nvrep - includes VREP scene and\nimage of the playing field.\nodometrium - includes the class for robot odometry.\nFrom Odometrium.\npdf - includes PDF assignment.\nimage - includes the images for readme and PDF.\nvideos - includes the video of simulated run (vrep.mp4)\nand video of the real run (real.mp4). The folder includes also the GIF version\nof videos.\n\nRobots\nBoth of the robots have the same possible commands.\nList of commands:\n\nmove_forward(speed, time) - moves robot forward.\nmove_backward(speed, time) - moves robot backward.\nrotate_right(speed, time) - rotates robot right, on place.\nrotate_left(speed, time) - rotates robot left, on place.\nstop() - stops the robot.\ncolor() - returns color which is being seen by the color sensor. In\nintensity from 0 to 100.\ntouch_right(), touch_left() - returns state of the right/left touch\nsensor. As 1 (pressed), 0(non-pressed)\nposition() - returns the position of the robot. Array [x,y], in metres.\n\nAI\nThe behaviour of the robot is divided in two steps:\n\nFollow the line - robot follows the line, until he come back to the\nstart position.\nRun from corner to corner - robot runs from bottom corner of the map\nto the upper corner of the map. In this part it does these things:\n\nMapping the field - add free position and position of obstacles\nto the map.\nAvoiding obstacles - if obstacle is found, robot moves to the safe\nposition and tries to get around it.\nLooking for final red point - if red is found, robot ends its\nmovement.\n\n\n\nProlog\nProlog is used for the main state machine during robots wandering through\nthe map. The behaviour is described in this file.\nThe main Python program is communicating with prolog interpreter with\nthe use of PySwip bridge. The position\nof the robot and all other changeable variables are dynamically asserted into prolog knowledge base and\nprolog is returning the proper state for the state machine.\nResults\nMore detailed results are described in report pdf file.\nHere will be described results just in short points.\nSimulated robot\nVideo result of simulated robot can be seen in video below.\n\n\nthe simulation works well and meets condition of the assignment\nthe only problem is that simulation is really dependent on CPU\nprocessing power\n\nadded CPU constant to easy adjustments\n\n\n\nReal robot\nThe video of real robot can be seen below.\n\nWith the real robot more problems occurred:\n\nWe were not able to install Prolog interpreter\n\nAI was rewritten to Python for robot\n\n\nThe odometry on robot is really inaccurate\n\nrobot is not as accurate as the simulated one\n\n\nColor sensor returned strange values sometimes\n\nwe put it closer to the ground\n\n\nOur created field was not really created perfectly\n\nFuture work\nIn the future, we could focus on these problems:\n\nInstall Prolog interpreter on the robot\nGet test with motors and odometry to get average error and invent some\nway how to face this problem\nCreate a better field for the robot, to better test its capabilities\nFind another way how to get data from robot to computer\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/rustlluk', 'info_list': ['3', 'Java', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Nov 5, 2020', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 21, 2020', '1', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', '1', 'Updated Feb 19, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 28, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '38 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/venkateshjoshi27', 'info_list': ['3', 'Java', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Nov 5, 2020', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 21, 2020', '1', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', '1', 'Updated Feb 19, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 28, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '0 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/geoffa74', 'info_list': ['3', 'Java', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Nov 5, 2020', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 21, 2020', '1', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 6, 2020', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', '1', 'Updated Feb 19, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 28, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020']}"

It uses flow charts to control task execution order. Robot Flow is based on concept by Mika Kaukoranta mika.kaukoranta@gmail.com\nHigh level process can be  designed in flowchart editor while RPA task steps are finished in Robot Framework. That makes overall flow easy to understand even for non programmers while still retaining Robot Framework more programming language like syntax for low level task implementation.\nRequired tools\n\nRobot Framework 3.2 alpha 1 or later (3.2.dev1)\nGraphml drawing tool like yEd Graph Editor\n\nInstallation\nDownload both files from from this repository listeners folder and place them in a suitable location. Usually recommended place is listeners folder next to tests folder.\nUsage\n\nCreate high a level RPA flow using flow chart editor.\nWrite RPA tasks with Robot Framework\nRobot Framework task name must match ones in flow chart. Names are case sensitive\nPlace both files in same directory and check that their names are same but with different suffix\nRun Robot Framework with RobotFlow listener robot -L RobotFlow.py mytask.robot\n\nDemo\nIntroduction\nThis repository contains a demo application and RPA scripts that show how this can be used. Application is in demo folder.\nScript reads customerid's from input.xml, checks their status from application and writes output to output.xml.\nThere are two robot files:\n\ncheckcustomer.robot\n\nThis script uses RobotFlow to control process execution\n\n\ncheckcustomer-rf.robot\n\nThis script is written in traditional Robot Framework style and does not use RobotFlow\n\n\n\nUsage instructions\nTo use demo application:\n\nInstall required libraries\nStart demoserver: python demoserver.py\nServer opens to localhost port 8080\nRun RPA with this command: robot --rpa --listener ../listeners/RobotFlow.py checkuser.robot\n\nTests\nTests are in test directory.

These are bare bones examples.\nSensor:   This is a Sample OpMode that shows how to use a specific sensor.\nIt is not intended as a functioning robot, it is simply showing the minimal code\nrequired to read and display the sensor values.\nHardware: This is not an actual OpMode, but a helper class that is used to describe\none particular robot\'s hardware devices: eg: for a Pushbot.  Look at any\nPushbot sample to see how this can be used in an OpMode.\nTeams can copy one of these to create their own robot definition.\nPushbot:  This is a Sample OpMode that uses the Pushbot robot structure as a base.\nConcept:\tThis is a sample OpMode that illustrates performing a specific function or concept.\nThese may be complex, but their operation should be explained clearly in the comments,\nor the header should reference an external doc, guide or tutorial.\nLibrary:  This is a class, or set of classes used to implement some strategy.\nThese will typically NOT implement a full OpMode.  Instead they will be included\nby an OpMode to provide some stand-alone capability.\n\nOnce you are familiar with the range of samples available, you can choose one to be the\nbasis for your own robot.  In all cases, the desired sample(s) needs to be copied into\nyour TeamCode module to be used.\nThis is done inside Android Studio directly, using the following steps:\n\n\nLocate the desired sample class in the Project/Android tree.\n\n\nRight click on the sample class and select ""Copy""\n\n\nExpand the  TeamCode / java folder\n\n\nRight click on the org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode folder and select ""Paste""\n\n\nYou will be prompted for a class name for the copy.\nChoose something meaningful based on the purpose of this class.\nStart with a capital letter, and remember that there may be more similar classes later.\n\n\nOnce your copy has been created, you should prepare it for use on your robot.\nThis is done by adjusting the OpMode\'s name, and enabling it to be displayed on the\nDriver Station\'s OpMode list.\nEach OpMode sample class begins with several lines of code like the ones shown below:\n @TeleOp(name=""Template: Linear OpMode"", group=""Linear Opmode"")\n @Disabled\n\nThe name that will appear on the driver station\'s ""opmode list"" is defined by the code:\nname=""Template: Linear OpMode""\nYou can change what appears between the quotes to better describe your opmode.\nThe ""group="" portion of the code can be used to help organize your list of OpModes.\nAs shown, the current OpMode will NOT appear on the driver station\'s OpMode list because of the\n@Disabled annotation which has been included.\nThis line can simply be deleted , or commented out, to make the OpMode visible.\nADVANCED Multi-Team App management:  Cloning the TeamCode Module\nIn some situations, you have multiple teams in your club and you want them to all share\na common code organization, with each being able to see the others code but each having\ntheir own team module with their own code that they maintain themselves.\nIn this situation, you might wish to clone the TeamCode module, once for each of these teams.\nEach of the clones would then appear along side each other in the Android Studio module list,\ntogether with the FtcRobotController module (and the original TeamCode module).\nSelective Team phones can then be programmed by selecting the desired Module from the pulldown list\nprior to clicking to the green Run arrow.\nWarning:  This is not for the inexperienced Software developer.\nYou will need to be comfortable with File manipulations and managing Android Studio Modules.\nThese changes are performed OUTSIDE of Android Studios, so close Android Studios before you do this.\nAlso..

In this, i am combining the robotics world with the gaming world. To achieve this, i build the following prototypes:\nGamify The Real Mobile Tank\nOften a human life is at risk when driver is participating in a racing sport or even driving on a normal road. This solution will enable a driver to control a real mobile tank or any other vehicle in a remote way, through a game. That is driver will play a game that in turn will move the real vehicle and hence participate in the race sport / normal driving. Driver can also keep the vehicle in autonomous mode when he/she is tired or taking a break.\nRobots are the future. Before letting a robot control human, let us see how we can control a robot. We have started with very basic robot which is basically a tank, which is being controlled wirelessly by a keyboard. Itâs a embedded program in python that is taking inputs from keyboard and sending signals to motors attached to tank. And the program is running on a small raspberry pi with raspbian os.\n\nRead First Demonstration here - https://www.delhitechnologyclub.com/mobiletank\nRead Second Demonstration here -

for autonomous, hanging, and shooting.\nSetup\nGeneral\n\nClone this repo\nRun ./gradlew to download gradle and needed FRC/Vendor libraries\nRun ./gradlew tasks to see available options\n\nVisual Studio Code (Official IDE)\n\nGet the WPILib extension for easiest use from the VSCode Marketplace - Requires Java 11 or greater\nIn .vscode/settings.json, set the User Setting, java.home, to the correct directory pointing to your JDK 11 directory\n\nBasic Gradle Commands\n\nRun ./gradlew deploy to deploy to the robot in Terminal (*nix) or Powershell (Windows)\nRun ./gradlew build to build the code. Use the --info flag for more details\nRun ./gradlew test to run all of the JUnit tests\n\nSubsystems\nDriveSubsystem\nDriveSubsystem.java contains code for both arcade and tank drives. arcadeDrive() utilizes the tankDrive(), so any changes made to the tankDrive function will also apply to arcadeDrive.\nThis subsystem also contains all of the talon/victor objects for the drive motors. The motor ports used are from Constants.java.\nDriveSubsystem is currently being used by a RunCommand() defined in RobotContainer's configureButtonBindings() function.\nHangSubsystem\nThis subsystem will be used for the motors or pneumatics systems that will help the robot hang on the shield generator in the endgame. This part of the robot has not been designed yet so this subsystem is incomplete.\nHangSubsystem is currently not being used by any command.\nRotateSubsystem\nRotateSubsystem contains code for reading the color value from the color sensor and classifying that color as Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, or Unknown. It also contains code for finding the target color to rotate the control panel to in stage 3. The color sensor object and encoder sensor object are stored in this subsystem. This subsystem contains the talon/victor object for rotating the control panel and a setSpeed() method for setting the speed of that motor.\ngetColor() returns a edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.util.Color object that contains the raw values of the color detected from the color sensor.\nguessColor(Color color) returns a ColorType enum value that represents if the passed in color is closest to Blue, Red, Green, or Yellow (or Unknown if the current color is not similar to any of those). The ColorType enum is specified in ColorType.java. This will work if the color sensor's LED is on or off, but it is generally more accurate when the LED is on.\ngetTargetColor() returns 'R', 'B', 'G', or 'Y' depending on which value was received by the DriverStation's game data. If no value was received (this will happen when stage 3 has not been reached) then getTargetColor() will return the integer 0 (not '0')\nsetSpeed(double speed) will set the rotate motor to the speed specified multiplied by Constants.Speeds.RotateSpeed.\nRotateSubsystem is currently used by the RotationalControl and PositionalControl commands.\nCommands\nAutonomousCommand\nAutonomousCommand.java currently has some placeholder code for an autonomous that will shoot three power cells at the target, back up, pick up more power cells, and launch those power cells at the target. This command has not been tested and requires more code for timing power cell shots, loading power cells, and turning the robot after shooting.\nRotationalControl\nRotationalControl.java will enable the rotate motor in RotateSubsystem until the robot has seen the same color 8 times (each color appears twice on the color panel, there are an extra 2 times in case a color doesn't get detected). If the robot cannot recognize the color when the command is initialized, it will be automatically canceled.\nRotationalControl is currently binded to a joystick button (the exact button is found in Constants.OI.AutoRotationalControl).\nPositionalControl\nPositionalControl.java will enable the robot motor in RotateSubsystem until the robot has seen the color that is perpendicular to the target color returned from RotateSubsystem::getTargetColor. If there is no target color returned (this will happen if stage 3 has not been reached), the command will automatically be canceled.\nPositionalControl is currently binded to a joystick button (the exact button is found in Constants.OI.AutoPositionalControl).\nConstants\nAll variables in Constants.java are public static final. Constants are organized in the following subclasses: MotorPorts, OI, SensorPorts, Speeds, and Pneumatics.\nTo get a value from Constants, use the format Constants.<subclass>.<value>.\nExample: Constants.MotorPorts.FrontRight\nRobotContainer\nRobotContainer.java contains all subsystem and command objects as well as OI objects and code. The OI code is written in configureButtonBindings(). It currently binds the joystick axis to arcade drive and binds buttons to the rotational and positional control commands. There is also a button that will output the current color detected to SmartDashboard.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/neonLian', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 10, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated

and Key Technologies of Multi AGV Logistics Sorting System\npaper link    If it\'s not convenient to download, leave an email in issues, and I\'ll send it to you when I have time\nDesign and Key Technologies of Multi AGV Logistics Sorting System\nABSTRACT\nThe sorting process of China\'s logistics industry is still at the stage of manual sorting, which has the problems of low sorting efficiency, high labor cost and high error rate. Automated logistics sorting is developing in the direction of intellectualization. AGV (automatic guide car) has the characteristics of high intelligence and high flexibility. Using a large number of AGV to pick up the express package can greatly improve the sorting efficiency, reduce the labor cost and reduce the error rate. The object of this paper is a multi AGV logistics sorting system. On the basis of the design of the multi AGV logistics sorting system, two key technologies of visual navigation, positioning and multi AGV path planning are studied. The main research work of this paper consists of three parts:\n\nresearch and implementation of AGV vision navigation and positioning technology. This paper analyzes the shortcomings of the existing visual navigation and positioning techniques, such as the expensive and inaccurate location of the camera, and proposes a visual navigation and positioning method based on the coded logo for these shortcomings. By this method, AGV can be used to navigate accurately even when the ordinary camera is running at a high speed. And precise positioning.\nthe research of multi AGV path planning method. The multi AGV logistics sorting system has the characteristics of complex path network and large number of AGV. The traditional multi AGV path planning method based on static determination of network is not suitable for multi AGV logistics sorting system. In this paper, based on the characteristics of multi AGV logistics sorting system, a path planning model based on dynamic random network is established, and the A* algorithm is improved, such as introducing time variables, considering the cost of turning and optimizing the OPEN table. Finally, the two path planning methods are analyzed and compared through experiments.\ndesign and implementation of multi AGV logistics sorting system. This paper focuses on the overall design of the multi AGV logistics sorting system. According to the design requirements, the express sorting robot is made, and the upper computer system software is developed based on the Java. The visual navigation and positioning method based on the coded symbol and the path planning method based on the dynamic random network are realized by using the C++ and OpenCv programming.\n\nModule introduction\nThe research of this paper is divided into three partsï¼expressãsmartcar-visionãsimulatorã\nexpress\ngithubå°å\nThe scheduling system is the brain of the whole multi AGV logistics sorting system, which is responsible for information co-ordination, scheduling and control of the express sorting robot. Based on Java, swing, spring boot, neety and other technologies, this project implements three path planning algorithms: improved a * algorithm, Dijkstra algorithm, greedy algorithm, and conflict prevention algorithm among multiple robots. Combined with the simulator project, it can simulate the scheduling of large-scale robotsãLarge scale robot scheduling simulation\nsmartcar-vision\ngithubå°å\nDemo robot video\nThe project is the brain of sorting robot, which realizes visual navigation, machine control and scheduling. Based on C + +, opencv, PID control and other technologies, the project runs on the embedded board of Jason TK1 (in fact, it is a Ubuntu system). Arduino is used for the bottom motor control. The project depends on hardware, with this code only helps to study the implementation of visual navigation, it is difficult to actually run.\nsimulator\ngithubå°å\nLarge scale robot scheduling simulation\nA sorting robot is not cheap, so there is no large-scale robot sorting experiment. In order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in this paper, the simulation software is developed. This project simulates the physical characteristics of the robot operation, and fully adapts to the scheduling system, which has no special customization.\nHow to run\nsmartcar-vision Engineering relies on physical hardware, so it\'s hard to run. The code inside can be used to learn machine vision. Here we mainly talk about how ""large scale robot scheduling simulation"" works.\nExpress and simulator are based on spring development of the swing project. Netty communication is used between them. Find the main function and run it. First run express, then run simulator. Both projects need to provide a map metadata excel file, and the warehouse has also prepared a graph.xls for you. When you run, you need to modify the file path in the comgraph file.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/xxxtai', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 10, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'Updated Jan 11, 2020', 'Updated Jan 11, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'MIT license', 'Updated Mar 10, 2020', '6', 'Java', 'Updated Jul 5, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 21, 2020', '10', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 6, 2021']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/FIRST-Team-2557-The-SOTABots', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 10, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 14, 2020', 'Updated Jan 11, 2020', 'Updated Jan 11, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'MIT license', 'Updated Mar 10, 2020', '6', 'Java', 'Updated Jul 5, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated Feb 21, 2020', '10', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', '2', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 6, 2021']}"

Each is\nentirely self-contained with its own power and control systems. A rough\nschematic of the Hull is available.\nHull\nThe Hull consists of 6 leg modules. Each leg has a control board for\nlocal joint coordination. This board uses an STM32F722 microcontroller to\ncommunicate with the joint angle sensors, the Enfield S2 servos, and the central\nmicrocontroller.  This processor measures the joint angles and provides\npneumatic cylinder length feedback as an analog voltage to the servos. Commands\nare provided over an RS485 serial connection using the Modbus protocol and can\nconfigure the servos, command a toe position, and provide status information\nsuch as measured leg position and cylinder pressures.\nThe central microcontroller is a BeagleBone AI running Debian Linux. Two\nexecutables are used during operation\nsbus_radio reads serial data from a FrSky\nreceiver and emits a stream of data using LCM.\nleg_control listens to these messages and\npasses them to a realtime\n(SCHED_FIFO) thread. This\nthread determines the desired toe positions and communicates with the legs over\nthe RS485 bus.\nTurret\nThe Turret uses the control electronics from the previous revision of\nChomp. This uses a single Arduino\nMega with an ATMega2560 to switch the pneumatic valves for firing the hammer and\ncommunicate with the control radio, turret rotation motor controller, LeddarTech\nM16-LSR, and telemetry radio. There is a nice overview of the control software\nhere. This software handles the automatic tracking and\nhammer firing using the ranging data from the LeddarTech M16-LSR, as well as\nprecisely scheduling the valve timings to ensure a clean throw and

In parenthesis the versions this project has been tested the last time.\n\nDebian (jester)\ngit (2.20.1)\nnpm (6.14.5)\nnode (v12.8.2)\nvue-cli (4.4.6)\n\nRequired materials\n\nUCTRONICS Robot Car Kit for Raspberry Pi\nRaspberry PI 3B+\nmicroSDHC Card\n\nBlock Diagram\n\nBlock diagram\nIn the block diagram above the green boxes represent the implementaton of this project.\nMJPEG Streamer\nThe MJPEG streamer project is used to stream the camera module video feed. Follow the complete instructions in the following link.\nMJPEG-Streamer Install & Setup\nGet a domain name\nIn order to access the Robot Car application from the internet get a domain name. DuckDNS will provide a duckdns subdomain resolving to your Internet Service Provider IP address.\nSet up the port forwarding on your home router\nOnce the domain name resolves to your home router external IP address, the router needs to forward traffic on ports 80 and 443 to your Raspberry Pi ip address. The instructions depends on your router. Information, very likely, is available by searching for ""port forwarding [your router brand and model]""\nNGINX installation\nIn this project we are using NGINX as web server and reverse proxy.\nGet an SSL certificate from LetsEncrypt\nWe need a valid certificate to establish a secure connection to the server running on the Raspberry PI.\nInstall certbot\nThe instructions below are from certbot.eff.org\n    sudo apt-get install certbot python-certbot-nginx\nContinue NGINX installation by removing apache if installed to avoid port conflicts\n    sudo apt-get remove apache2\nInstall nginx\n    sudo apt-get install nginx\nStart nginx\n    sudo systemctl start nginx\nTry it\nOpen a browser and enter:\nhttp://raspberry-pi-address\nGrab certificate for your domain\n    sudo certbot certonly --nginx -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com\nNote: replace example.com by your domain\nGenerate certificates for the nginx reverse proxying to the backend server\n    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 --nodes\nChange nginx configuration\nCreate a soft link from /etc/nginx/sites-availabe to nginx.conf (from the repo)\n    cd /etc/nginx/sites-available\n    sudo ln -s /home/pi/git/pi-robot-car/nginx.conf example.com\nMake the site enabled\n    cd /etc/nginx/sites-enable\n    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com example.com\nTry it using secure connection\n    https://example.com\nEvery 3 months the ceritificate needs to be renewed\nTo obtain a new or tweaked version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again with the ""certonly"" option. To non-interactively renew all of your certificates, run ""certbot renew""\nSetup, and run the server and web application\nClone this repository\n    git clone git@github.com:wdmartins/pi-robot-car.git\nInstall project dependencies\n    cd pi-robot-car\n    npm install\nStart backend server\n    npm start\nCompiles and hot-reloads for development\nUse this option for development purposes.

As the robot only has access to one sin- gle camera, monocular slam would be an ideal candidate for providing an excellent simultaneous localisation and mapping strategy.\nDemo\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/ferdinandl007', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 10, 2020', 'Objective-C', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', '5', 'G-code', 'Updated Feb 18, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Jul 12, 2020', 'CSS', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Updated Jan 9, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '17 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['2020-Infinite-Recharge\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Team5901', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 10, 2020', 'Objective-C', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', '5', 'G-code', 'Updated Feb 18, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Jul 12, 2020', 'CSS', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Updated Jan 9, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'Cuneo', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '71 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Robotic-hand\nProject of Bagnis Gabriele, Bruno Luca, Cuniberti Andrea, Genovese Tommaso and Giavelli Luca.\n\n\nOur Project\n\n\nOur Team\n\n\nRobotic Hand\n\n\nThe Programs\n\n\nThe material\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\nWe thank the Italian Institute of Technology of Genoa for providing us with the material and ideas and the ITIS Mario Delpozzo of Cuneo for helping us during this project.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Bagnis-Gabriele', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 10, 2020', 'Objective-C', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', '5', 'G-code', 'Updated Feb 18, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Jul 12, 2020', 'CSS', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Updated Jan 9, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/auto-pilot', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 10, 2020', 'Objective-C', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', '5', 'G-code', 'Updated Feb 18, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Jul 12, 2020', 'CSS', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Updated Jan 9, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'Moscow', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '22 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Bronskiy', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 10, 2020', 'Objective-C', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', '5', 'G-code', 'Updated Feb 18, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Jul 12, 2020', 'CSS', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Updated Jan 9, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['HOU_2019-2020\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/SpragueRoboticsTeam', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 10, 2020', 'Objective-C', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', '5', 'G-code', 'Updated Feb 18, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Jul 12, 2020', 'CSS', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Updated Jan 9, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'Volos', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '0 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['RoboDiSS\nOn site Plant Diagnosis Support System based on IoT Robotics\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/apoxen', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 10, 2020', 'Objective-C', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', '5', 'G-code', 'Updated Feb 18, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Jul 12, 2020', 'CSS', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Updated Jan 9, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'Shenzhen, China', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '0 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': [""\nHomeServiceRobot\nFinal project of the Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree\nSet-up\n\nInstall catkin_pkg module. Run the following three commands:\n\npip install catkin_pkg\npip install rosdep rosinstall_generator wstool rosinstall six vcstools\npip install pydot\n\nActivate the right conda environment\nIt seems that /root/.bashrc is setting up conda to work with Python3. But the default version of python for ros-kinetic is python2. For that reason, we start a conda environment that was created for our nanodegree.\nOpen a Terminator and write:\n\nconda init bash\nClose this terminal and open a new one. There, write:\nconda activate /opt/robond/py2\nNow the line in the terminal starts with (/opt/robond/py2). Great! Stay in this terminal :)\n\nUpdate/upgrade apt\n\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\n\nGo to your workspace and clone the repository\n\ngit clone https://github.com/chk121/HomeServiceRobot.git $PATH_TO_PARENT_DIR/home_service_robot\n\n\nBuild all packages involved\n\ncd $PATH_TO_PARENT_DIR/home_service_robot\ncatkin_make\n\nInstall xterminal\nThe scripts that take care of launching all processes for each of the functional steps in this projects use xterminal as a mean to produce independent new terminals that will run a certain set of commands. To install it, one just needs to run\n\nsudo apt install xterm\nNote that to terminate correctly all processes open, it is necessary to do Ctrl+C in each of the xterminal open. Otherwise, even if we close all related windows, processes such as gzserver could still be running under the hood, and that would prevent us from running some other script or using gazebo for some other purpose.\n\nSet-up environment\nIn every new terminal, it is necessary to\n\ncd $PATH_TO_PARENT_DIR/home_service_robot\nsource src/scripts/set_environment.sh\nMapping\nIt is as simple as running the command\nchmod +x src/scripts/test_slam.sh\n./src/scripts/test_slam.sh\nThis script will launch:\n\nTurtlebot inside the world in src/world.\ngmapping demo\nrviz with a configuration that will show navigation\nkeyboard_teleop, a node that will allow you to command the turtlebot with your keyboard\n\nIn order to map a different world, edit src/scripts/test_slam.sh substituting the path to your .world file after world_file:=.\nDrive the turtlebot around for a while and when you are happy with the map, before terminating gmapping node, use the following command in a new terminal (setting it up as explained above):\nrosrun map_server map_saver -f /path/to/map/name\nDo not include any extension, as this command will create both the .pgm file with the map and the .yaml configuration file.\nLocalization and navigation\nNow that we created a map for our world, our robot will be able to localize itself in the map and also navigate to any goal in its reach. In the case of the localization, we are using AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization). For navigation, we rely on ROS Navigation stack, which is based on Dijkstra's algorithm. To see it in action:\nchmod +x src/scripts/test_navigation.sh\n./src/scripts/test_navigation.sh\nIn the case we are using another world, we would only need to edit src/scripts/test_navigation.sh substituting the path to the target .world file after world_file:= and the location of the configuration for the map we created in the previous section after map_file:=. In this case, we need to explicitely add the extension .yaml to the command.\nNow go to the xterminal that is running rviz, select 2D Nav Goal and locate it wherever in the map you want the robot to move.\nROS nodes\nLet's now introduce the two nodes that were written for this project: pick_objects and add_markers.\npick_objects\nInstead of adding the goals manually, we would like to have a node that does this for us. pick_objects will command our robot to:\n\nGo to a pick-up location in our map\nWait for 5 seconds (simulating picking up a virtual object)\nGo to a drop-off location in our map\nInform us at every stage\n\nBoth pick-up and drop-off targets can be customized as parameters in src/pick_objects/launch/pick_objects.launch.\nTo test this node, we need to run:\nchmod +x src/scripts/pick_objects.sh\n./src/scripts/pick_objects.sh\nin a properly set up terminal.\nadd_markers\nThis node serves us as visual aid to show what the robot is asked to do. The node will publish markers (so that rviz can display them) related to the actions commanded by pick_objects. There are two modes for this node:\n\nRobot independent\n\nThis mode is basically the testing phase of our node. The behaviour expected is:\n\nShow marker in pick-up zone for 5 seconds\nHide marker\nWait 5 seconds\nShow marker in drop-off zone\n\nTo test it, run\nchmod +x src/scripts/add_markers.sh\n./src/scripts/add_markers.sh\n\nRobot dependent\n\nIn this case, the node is tracking the robot and will:\n\nShow marker in pick-up zone\nHide marker once robot reaches pick-up zone\nShow marker in drop-off zone once the roboto reaches it\n\nWe will test this node in the next and last step, as we will need to integrate it with pick_objects.\nPick-up and drop-off zones for both modes can be set through parameters in src/add_markers/launch/add_markers.launch and src/add_markers/add_markers_tracking_robot.launch respectively.\nHome Service Robot\nFinally, we integrate all the previous parts to achieve the following:\n\nRobot can localize itself and navigate through the map\nIt goes to the pick up zone, marked with a blue marker visible in rviz\nOnce there, the marker disappears and the robot waits for 5 seconds, simulating picking up the virtual object\nThe robot goes then to the drop-off zone\nOnce there, a blue marker is displayed\n\nRun the following commands to see this process:\nchmod +x src/scripts/home_service.sh\n./src/scripts/home_service.sh\nReference\nPenguinLemma's repository\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/chk121', 'info_list': ['Updated Jan 8, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jan 10, 2020', 'Objective-C', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 3, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 11, 2020', '5', 'G-code', 'Updated Feb 18, 2020', '1', 'C++', 'Updated Jul 12, 2020', 'CSS', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020', 'Updated Jan 9, 2020', 'Updated Jan 7, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 12, 2020']}"

Each event brings together 40-60 different teams, in which they compete in randomly assigned qualification matches for a spot in in the finals.\nEach match is designed such that 3 robots play against 3 other robots. It becomes imperative that a team has readily available statistics on the abilities of every robot on the field. This can help enable a team to devise a successful strategy.\nThe main objectives for the Phoenix Scout system are:\n\n\nEasy Data Entry\n\nA student is assigned to collect performance data on a robot, where they gather relevant data on the robot's performance. Many solutions in the past have primarily used either paper forms, a centralized excel sheet to process the data, or a combination thereof. This often involves a lot of manual work to centralize all this data, and even more consideration to keep all this data in sync. This can be fully automated, as this project sets out to accomplish.\n\n\n\nImmediate Data Views\n\nPrevious solutions have always required some element of manual work to process raw data and put this into the hands of those who need it. The solution presented here seeks to eliminate this completely by hosting a centralized backend API service which becomes the source of truth.\n\n\n\nOffline-first access\n\nThere are many unique constraints that the physical venue poses. Often, due to dense concentration of people at these events, the network service may be limited. Therefore, a requirement of a fully online system requires that no data is lost if network service is unavailable, and that changes are synced once the device comes back online.\n\n\n\nInstall\nThis application consists of a frontend, backend, and database layer. This project utilizes docker to manage each process.\n\nDuplicate and rename the sample .env-example file to .env.\nInstall docker and docker-compose for your operating system.\nRun the following command\n\n> docker-compose up -d\n\nVisit localhost:3000 in the web browser.\n\nOverall Software Architecture\nTechnologies Used\n\nReact (utilizes React Hooks)\nMongoDB\nNode.js backend (Express framework)\n\nRequirements\nOffline Architecture\nThe central requirement for this application is to enable seamless data entry/display irrespective of one's network connectivity -- If connection to the server is broken, one can still enter new data and see changes reflected immediately.\nImmediate data access drives the need to hold all data in memory. With data cached in memory, data access is possible irrespective of network connectivity. The problem to be solved is how to reconcile a possibly modified local cache of data with possibly modified data from the server.\nThis is the problem of concurrency in a multi-user application, where applications such as Google Drive seek to reconcile a stream of data changes all happening at once.\nFor the purposes of this application, it was determined that updates do not have to happen in real-time. For this reason, the proposed solution implemented in this application is to:\n\nHave data held in memory as the source of truth. Any updates to a preexisting document changes this in-memory data, and additionally adds the unique document key to a queue.\nWhen data is to be synced with the server, this queue is used to find documents that were changed locally, pushing the newest state of these documents to the server before draining this queue.\n\nThis solution meets the requirement that the application provides a way to add/update existing data in an offline-first environment.\nThis solution was implemented as follows:\n\n\nClient (Link to Custom Hook)\n\n\nA custom React hook was written which manages the offline flow. A diagram of the hook architecture is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer (Link to Controller)\n\nThe solution described requires that the backend exposes a GET/POST REST endpoint. The GET endpoint returns a dump of all data, where the POST endpoint accepts full document objects. New documents not already present in the database will be inserted into the database, while if a document ID is passed inside of the object, then MongoDB will try to modify an existing document accordingly.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/adamgarcia4', 'info_list': ['Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', '1', 'TypeScript', 'Updated Mar 15, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Mar 5, 2021', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jul 15, 2020', 'LabVIEW', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', '1', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 30, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 12, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 10, 2020', 'OpenSCAD', 'MIT license', 'Updated Dec 5, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/NU-MSR', 'info_list': ['Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', '1', 'TypeScript', 'Updated Mar 15, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Mar 5, 2021', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jul 15, 2020', 'LabVIEW', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', '1', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 30, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 12, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 10, 2020', 'OpenSCAD', 'MIT license', 'Updated Dec 5, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '99 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Mr-Roboto\nRobot code repository for the BID robot competition.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/BennytheBomb', 'info_list': ['Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jan 24, 2020', '1', 'TypeScript', 'Updated Mar 15, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Mar 5, 2021', 'C++', 'Updated Jan 23, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Jul 15, 2020', 'LabVIEW', 'Updated Jan 8, 2020', '1', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 30, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 12, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Mar 10, 2020', 'OpenSCAD', 'MIT license', 'Updated Dec 5, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['Introduction\nThis is the official website for the 76209 VEX Robotics team.\nLocal Deploy\nThis site can be cloned and started using npm run start.

If the maximum 1616 frame number exceeded â script automatically stop play the entire scene. Please notice: an 1616 frame number means an 404 animation frame number (1616 / 4 == 404).\nAfter record animation you can create an AVI video from that animation and load it to the YouTube, how did I:\n\nVideo 1\nVideo 2\n\nAlgorithm explanation\n\n\nCar speed up (with some acceleration value) and move forward until it bumps into a wall or an other object.\n\n\nAfter collision - it roll backward and turn left (version 1).

and Key Technologies of Multi AGV Logistics Sorting System\npaper link    If it\'s not convenient to download, leave an email in issues, and I\'ll send it to you when I have time\nDesign and Key Technologies of Multi AGV Logistics Sorting System\nABSTRACT\nThe sorting process of China\'s logistics industry is still at the stage of manual sorting, which has the problems of low sorting efficiency, high labor cost and high error rate. Automated logistics sorting is developing in the direction of intellectualization. AGV (automatic guide car) has the characteristics of high intelligence and high flexibility. Using a large number of AGV to pick up the express package can greatly improve the sorting efficiency, reduce the labor cost and reduce the error rate. The object of this paper is a multi AGV logistics sorting system. On the basis of the design of the multi AGV logistics sorting system, two key technologies of visual navigation, positioning and multi AGV path planning are studied. The main research work of this paper consists of three parts:\n\nresearch and implementation of AGV vision navigation and positioning technology. This paper analyzes the shortcomings of the existing visual navigation and positioning techniques, such as the expensive and inaccurate location of the camera, and proposes a visual navigation and positioning method based on the coded logo for these shortcomings. By this method, AGV can be used to navigate accurately even when the ordinary camera is running at a high speed. And precise positioning.\nthe research of multi AGV path planning method. The multi AGV logistics sorting system has the characteristics of complex path network and large number of AGV. The traditional multi AGV path planning method based on static determination of network is not suitable for multi AGV logistics sorting system. In this paper, based on the characteristics of multi AGV logistics sorting system, a path planning model based on dynamic random network is established, and the A* algorithm is improved, such as introducing time variables, considering the cost of turning and optimizing the OPEN table. Finally, the two path planning methods are analyzed and compared through experiments.\ndesign and implementation of multi AGV logistics sorting system. This paper focuses on the overall design of the multi AGV logistics sorting system. According to the design requirements, the express sorting robot is made, and the upper computer system software is developed based on the Java. The visual navigation and positioning method based on the coded symbol and the path planning method based on the dynamic random network are realized by using the C++ and OpenCv programming.\n\nModule introduction\nThe research of this paper is divided into three partsï¼expressãsmartcar-visionãsimulatorã\nexpress\ngithubå°å\nThe scheduling system is the brain of the whole multi AGV logistics sorting system, which is responsible for information co-ordination, scheduling and control of the express sorting robot. Based on Java, swing, spring boot, neety and other technologies, this project implements three path planning algorithms: improved a * algorithm, Dijkstra algorithm, greedy algorithm, and conflict prevention algorithm among multiple robots. Combined with the simulator project, it can simulate the scheduling of large-scale robotsãLarge scale robot scheduling simulation\nsmartcar-vision\ngithubå°å\nDemo robot video\nThe project is the brain of sorting robot, which realizes visual navigation, machine control and scheduling. Based on C + +, opencv, PID control and other technologies, the project runs on the embedded board of Jason TK1 (in fact, it is a Ubuntu system). Arduino is used for the bottom motor control. The project depends on hardware, with this code only helps to study the implementation of visual navigation, it is difficult to actually run.\nsimulator\ngithubå°å\nLarge scale robot scheduling simulation\nA sorting robot is not cheap, so there is no large-scale robot sorting experiment. In order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in this paper, the simulation software is developed. This project simulates the physical characteristics of the robot operation, and fully adapts to the scheduling system, which has no special customization.\nHow to run\nsmartcar-vision Engineering relies on physical hardware, so it\'s hard to run. The code inside can be used to learn machine vision. Here we mainly talk about how ""large scale robot scheduling simulation"" works.\nExpress and simulator are based on spring development of the swing project. Netty communication is used between them.
