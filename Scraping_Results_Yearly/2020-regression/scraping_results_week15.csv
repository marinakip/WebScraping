it?\nImagine you start a new job on an already existing product. The former and only developer of the solution hands you over the source code and runs to the exit, leaving you wondering what is happening...\nAnd then you look at the code and damn! You didn\'t even know it was possible to write bad code in Elm, but here it is. The most obfuscated human-written code you\'ve ever seen!\nThe product won\'t survive if you can\'t refactor this to improve the code. Fortunately this is Elm so refactoring is easy, right? Wait a minute, what does this function do? And this one? And what the heck is this type representing? Nor the naming nor the types help you in any way to understand what is happening here.\nYou just know the current implementation works and that you should not break it. You have to refactor without altering a behaviour you don\'t know. How to do that?\nYou\'ve guessed it! Regression testing!\nWhen do I need regression testing?\nWhen you need to refactor a code without knowing exactly what this code does. This could be because it\'s not your code and you do not have the specifications, or maybe because the code has grown more and more complex overtime and nobody knows everything anymore. The only thing you now is that the current implementation is considered correct and you do not want to break it while refactoring it.\nIn fact, even if there are bugs in this piece of code, you don\'t want to fix them during this refactoring: this is something that you will address later, once the code is easier to work with: make the change easy [...] then make the easy change (piece of wisdom from Kent Beck). Discover more on this thanks to Dillon Kearns.\nIf you know well what your code is supposed to do, unit tests or fuzz tests through elm-test directly may suit you better.\nHow does it work?\n\nWatch the video explaining the concept along with a specific use case (hopefully, you will forgive me for my english 😅)\nWell, you can take your program, generate an initial model, generate random messages, send them to your update method and save the final model. Without knowing exactly what happened, you now have a test that – given an initial model and some inputs – produces a specific output. Now, generate 100s of them, and save the inputs and the output to run them later again. Refactor the part of the code that you want, and once done run the tests again, comparing the final output with the previous final output. Are they the same for every test? Great, you have improved the code without breaking anything! Some tests don\'t pass? You\'ve just changed the behaviour and should try to fix that mistake!\nThese generated tests are called a test harness and are here to help you improve the code. We can see four steps:\n\nCreate a generator for your test harness\nGenerate and save the test harness\nRefactor your code\nRe-run the tests and compare the outputs with saved outputs\n\nIf this package can\'t help you for step 3 (this is your job!), it can help you for the other steps. Let\'s see how.\nIn the following examples, let\'s imagine that we want to build a test harness for the counter program.\nCreate a generator for your test harness\nThis package will help you generate tests, but it needs a few inputs from you:\n\n\nFirst install the package as a test dependency through elm-test: elm-test install jgrenat/regression-testing.\n\n\nWe need to know how to generate an initial model for your program: your job is to create a generator using the elm/random package. Let\'s see an example for the counter program:\nimport Random exposing (Generator)\nimport Counter exposing (Model)\n\nmodelGenerator : Generator Model\nmodelGenerator = Random.int -10 10\nOr if your initial model is always the same, you can use a constant generator:\nmodelGenerator : Generator Model\nmodelGenerator = Random.constant 0\n\n\nDefine how to generate a message for your application:\nimport Counter exposing (Msg(..))\nimport Random exposing (Generator)\n\nmodelGenerator : Generator Msg\nmodelGenerator = Random.uniform Increment [Decrement]\n\n-- If some messages should be more frequent than others, you can use Random.weighted.\n\n\nDefine how encode your model and your messages into JSON to save them, using the elm/json package.\nimport Counter exposing (Model, Msg(..))\nimport Json.Encode as Encode\n\nencodeModel : Model -> Encode.Value\nencodeModel model = Encode.int model\n\nencodeMessage : Msg -> Encode.Value\nencodeMessage msg =\n    case msg of\n        Increment ->\n            Encode.string ""INCREMENT""\n        Decrement ->\n            Encode.string ""DECREMENT""\n\n-- You can find more complex examples in the ""examples"" folder\n\n\nDeclare a port to get back the generated tests:\nport module RegressionTestGenerator exposing (main)\nimport Json.Encode as Encode\n\n-- The name is important, it should be ""outputPort""\nport outputPort : Encode.Value -> Cmd msg\n\n\nOnce you have everything ready, you can create the generator:\nport module RegressionTestGenerator exposing (main)\n\nimport Counter exposing (Model, Msg, update)\nimport RegressionTest.Generator exposing (RegressionTestGeneratorProgram)\n\nmain : RegressionTestGeneratorProgram Model Msg\nmain = RegressionTest.Generator.sandboxUpdate\n    { modelGenerator = modelGenerator\n    , messageGenerator = messageGenerator\n    , update = update\n    , encodeModel = encodeModel\n    , encodeMessage = encodeMessage\n    , outputPort = outputPort\n    , numberOfTests = 500\n    }\nGenerate and save the test harness\nWe\'re going to use the node module to generate this one, so you\'ll need to have NodeJS installed. Then, you can install the tool:\nnpm install --global @jgrenat/elm-regression-testing\nTo generate the tests, go to the root of your project, assuming that the TestGenerator file is in the tests directory, run this command:\nelm-regression-testing ./tests/RegressionTestGenerator.elm\nThis will generate the file ./tests/GeneratedRegressionTestData.elm containing the tests data. If you want to change the path or the name of the file, you can use the --output option:\nelm-regression-testing ./tests/RegressionTestGenerator.elm --output=./tests/CustomFileName.elm\nRefactor your code\nI\'m afraid I won\'t be of any help here, you don\'t want me to take your job anyway... 😁\nRe-run the tests and compare the outputs with saved outputs\nThe tests data have been saved, now we need to re-run these tests and compare the results.\nFor that, we need to know how to decode the model and the messages from the generated JSON:\nimport Counter exposing (Model, Msg(..))\nimport Json.Decode as Decode exposing (Decoder)\n\nmodelDecoder : Decoder Model\nmodelDecoder = Decode.int\n\nmessageDecoder : Decoder Msg\nmessageDecoder =\n    Decode.string\n    |> Decode.andThen (\\messageType -> \n        case msg of\n            ""INCREMENT"" ->\n                Decode.succeed Increment\n            ""DECREMENT"" ->\n                Decode.succeed Decrement\n            _ ->\n                Decode.fail (""Invalid message: "" ++ messageType)\n    )\n  \n-- You can find more complex examples in the ""examples"" folder\nThen, you can create a runner:\nmodule RegressionTestRunner exposing (suite)\n\nimport Counter exposing (update)\nimport GeneratedRegressionTestData exposing (testData)\nimport RegressionTest.Runner\nimport Test exposing (Test)\n\n\nsuite : Test\nsuite = \n    RegressionTest.Runner.element \n        { modelDecoder = modelDecoder\n        , messageDecoder = messageDecoder\n        , update = update\n        } testData\n  \nAnd launch it as usual through:\nelm-test\nThis requires that at some point you\'ve set up elm-explorations/test for your project.\nI want to refactor my model / my messages! 😱\nIf you want to change the representation of your model or change the messages of your app, there is no problem, your test harness is still there!\nAs the test data are stored as JSON, you can decode it as you want!\nLet\'s imagine that you want to change the model in the Counter example to allow adding more informations in the future:\n-- Previous Model was simply an Int, we want to use a record containing that Int after our refactoring:\n\ntype alias Model = { value : Int }\nYou can change your decoder to follow this change:\nmodelDecoder : Decoder Model\nmodelDecoder = \n    Decode.int\n    |> Decode.map Model\nAnd run your tests with elm-test!\nThanks\nMany thanks to @FBerthelot and @jfmengels for their precious help during the conception of this tool!\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/jgrenat', 'info_list': ['3', 'Updated Apr 25, 2020', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', '23', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 28, 2021', '22', 'JavaScript', 'BSD-3-Clause license', 'Updated Apr 20, 2020', 'Java', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Jan 29, 2021', '4', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 30, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 18, 2020', '4', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Feb 24, 2021', 'Shell', 'Updated Feb 27, 2021', '4', 'Python', 'Updated Oct 27, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['vivo-regression-tests - release 2021-\nFor UQAM-DEV Environment: For UQAM-DEV Environment: https://wiki.uqam.ca/display/VIVOPUB/4%29+vivo-regression-test%3A+a+Test+Bench+Tool++for+the+Continuous+Evaluation+of+VIVO%27s+Development\nSetup\n\nrename example.settings.xml to settings.xml and Update the settings.xml based on the usernames/passwords for your local VIVO installations and the appropriate Selenium driver for your platform.\nin ./src/main/resources rename example.runtime.properties to runtime.properties and example.log4j.properties to log4j.properties\nThe list of tests is available under: ./src/main/resources/testsuites/\nMake sure that the password for http://localhost:8080/vivo_orig is correctly assigned.

The order of the polynomial will be one less than the number of provided points. The fields of PropsBaseCurve are still optional, but the points field is required:\n\nJavaScript Example\nconst curve2 = {\n  points: [\n    [0, 0],\n    [1, 1],\n  ],\n};\n\n\nTypeScript Example\nimport { PropsCurvePoints } from \'polynomial-curve-fitting/lib/types\';\nconst curve2: PropsCurvePoints = {\n  points: [\n    [0, 0],\n    [1, 1],\n  ],\n};\n\n\n\nUse PropsCurveOrder to specify the order of the polynomial. The points on the curve are randomly generated. The fields of PropsBaseCurve are still optional, but the polynomialOrder field is required:\n\nJavaScript Example\nconst curve3 = {\n  polynomialOrder: 2,\n};\n\n\nTypeScript Example\nimport { PropsCurveOrder } from \'polynomial-curve-fitting/lib/types\';\nconst curve3: PropsCurveOrder = {\n  polynomialOrder: 2,\n};\n\n\n\nUse PropsCurveCoefficients to specify the coefficients of the polynomial. When optionally specifying points, the x values are taken to create points on the curve (ideally the y values match). If no points have been specified, they are randomly generated. The fields of PropsBaseCurve are still optional, but the coefficients field is required:\n\nJavaScript Example\nconst curve4 = {\n  coefficients: [-0.1, 1.25, 5],\n  points: [\n    [0, 5],\n    [1, 6.15],\n    [2, 7.1],\n  ],\n};\n\n\nTypeScript Example\nimport { PropsCurveCoefficients } from \'polynomial-curve-fitting/lib/types\';\nconst curve4: PropsCurveCoefficients = {\n  coefficients: [-0.1, 1.25, 5],\n  points: [\n    [0, 5],\n    [1, 6.15],\n    [2, 7.1],\n  ],\n};\n\n\n\nProvide the information about the curve as follows:\n\nJavaScript Example\nimport PolynomialCurveFitting from \'polynomial-curve-fitting\';\nimport React from \'react\';\n\n// const curve ...\n\nconst App = () => <PolynomialCurveFitting curve={curve}></PolynomialCurveFitting>;\n\nexport default App;\n\n\nTypeScript Example\nimport PolynomialCurveFitting from \'polynomial-curve-fitting\';\nimport React from \'react\';\n\n// const curve ...\n\nconst App = () => <PolynomialCurveFitting curve={curve}></PolynomialCurveFitting>;\n\nexport default App;\n\nProvide Settings\nIn addition to the curve prop, there is also a settings prop that allows to set the style of the drawn graph (e.g, the size of the svg, font sizes, colors, and spacing). Have a look at the default props to see the default settings and what can be changed.\nconst App = () => <PolynomialCurveFitting settings={settings}></PolynomialCurveFitting>;\nGet Curve\nTo get updates on the curve while changing it within the component, use a callback function as shown in the following example:\n\nJavaScript Example\nimport PolynomialCurveFitting from \'polynomial-curve-fitting\';\nimport React from \'react\';\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const [curve, setCurve] = React.useState();\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <PolynomialCurveFitting curveChange={value => setCurve(value)}></PolynomialCurveFitting>\n      <pre>\n        {JSON.stringify(curve, (_, v) => (v instanceof Array ? JSON.stringify(v, null) : v), 3)}\n      </pre>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n\n\nTypeScript Example\nimport PolynomialCurveFitting from \'polynomial-curve-fitting\';\nimport { CurveOut } from \'polynomial-curve-fitting/lib/types\';\nimport React from \'react\';\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const [curve, setCurve] = React.useState<CurveOut>();\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <PolynomialCurveFitting\n        curveChange={(value: CurveOut) => setCurve(value)}\n      ></PolynomialCurveFitting>\n      <pre>\n        {JSON.stringify(curve, (_, v) => (v instanceof Array ? JSON.stringify(v, null) : v), 3)}\n      </pre>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n\nSet Translations\nThe internationalization prop accepts a PropsInternationalization object specifying translations. Depending on the current UI language change the i18n object in the following example to either ENGLISH or GERMAN. Have a look at the default props to see the default strings and what can be changed. Note that every string is optional.\n\nJavaScript Example\nimport PolynomialCurveFitting from \'polynomial-curve-fitting\';\nimport React from \'react\';\n\nconst ENGLISH = {\n  textSettings: { title:

I’ve been a baseball fan, specifically of the Yankees, since around 10 years old. I would watch the games with my family and we would cause so much commotion that my mother would think something bad had happened. I became such a giant fan of the Yankees throughout the years that I even got season tickets. Admittingly, I started to grow tired of baseball after that year, maybe it was all the travelling to the Bronx that I had to do, but in recent years my interest has started to slowly grow back. Therefore, for this analysis I’m interested in seeing how specific variables affect hits.\nData Source\nI was able to pull up the statistic for the starting lineup for 2017 of all Major League Baseball Teams on the following website:\nhttps://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2017.shtml\nVariables\nThere are a total of 246 observations in this dataset. For this analysis the dependent variable is the total number of hits for each player and the independent variables are batting average, age, strikeouts, and at bats.\nHits: When the batter safely reaches first base after hitting the ball in fair territory\nBatting Average: Number of hits divided by at bats\nAge: Age of the batter\nStrikeouts: Occurs when the batter racks up 3 strikes for failure to hit the ball into fair territory\nWalks: occurs when a batter receives four pitches outside the strike zone and is in turn awarded first base\n\nA Simple Regression Model\nScatterplot\n\nI don’t see obvious curvature in my data. We can see a bit of heteroscedasticity towards the bottom of the scatterplot. The pink line illustrates the vertical cut in the data. It could be that these players didn’t play a full season due to an injury or they might have just had a very bad year. No real leverage or outliers exist in this scatterplot. The two points that are separated by the pink line fall in line with the rest of the data and aren’t dramatically far away from the rest of the data points.\nThe Linear Regression Model\nYx= βo + β1x + ε\n(a)\tYx = subpopulation average, which is normally distributed, of hits that share the same batting average.\n(b)\tE(Yx) = the expected value of the random variable, Hits, conditional on knowing the batting average. For example, it is the expected value of the subpopulation average of hits given all the players with 0.250 batting average.\n(c)\tV(Yx) = the variance of the random variable hits given the players with a batting average of 0.250.\nSAS Output for the Fitted Model\n  \nAt a given count of x, say in my case is a batting average of 0.250, we can picture a vertical line down that count, illustrated in green. That vertical line intersects the 2 dotted lines. The y coordinates of those intersections, illustrated by the purple dots, define the endpoints for the 95% prediction interval for the number of hits of the 247th (the next observation) player. As the vertical line passes through the shaded band, given by the pink slanted lines, it defines the 95% confidence interval for the subpopulation expected value of hits given a batting average of 0.250. Where the vertical line intersects the  line, the red dot, it gives us the point prediction of the number of hits of the 247th player with a batting average of 0.250.\nAnalysis of Output\nThe t-test\ni. We are testing if the population slope for hits and batting average is equal to zero.\nho = β1 =0\nho = β1 ≠ 0\nii. Test statistic: t-stat =  (b1 - β1/(s/√SSx)  =  (760.15209-0)/59.89739=12.69\nRejection Region: |12.69| > 1.970, α=0.05\nt-critcal value with 2 d.f. = 1.970\nConclusion :\tnull hypothesis is rejected because the |t-stat| = |12.69| greater than the t-critical value of 1.970\nThe yhat equation\nThe equation for the fitted model is as follows:\nyhat = -79.721 + 760.152x\nModel Selection\nBest Subsets Model Selection\n\nI tried taking log and square root transformations, but I didn’t notice any obvious improvements in the data. In the scatterplot showing Hits and Age, I don’t see an obvious relationship. It seems to be negatively correlated but it isn’t a very strong one. In the scatterplot showing Hits vs. Walks there are a couple of leverage points which I have circled in purple. They lie a bit far in the horizontal direction, away from the rest of the data.\n \nThe model I prefer includes Walks, Batting Average and Strikeouts. C(p), AIC, BIC, and SBC, all agree that a model with 4 parameters is best, which means the model has 3 regressors. Next to the star aligned with the 4 parameters, a 2 is shown. Therefore, looking at the Summary Table above Model number 2 shows that the best model includes, Walks, Batting Average, and Strikeouts.\nForward Stepwise Model Selection\nAccording to the summary of the Stepwise Model Selection, the first variable selected was Batting Average. Then it added Strikeouts and did not remove Batting Average. Next, it added Walks and did not remove any of the previous variables. Finally, the selection method stopped and did not add the last variable which is Age.\n \nThe Stepwise Selection method choose the same model as the best subsets method.\nCook's D\nBelow are the diagnostic plots for the model selected above. The plots show the flagged players according to Cook’s D and Outlier and Leverage Plot. Aaron Judge seems to be the most obvious influential point according to both diagnostic plots.\n \nVariance Inflation\nVariance Inflation, shows if multicollinearity exists in our analysis. If the VIF is high, the variance of the standard errors of the slope is increased because of collinearity. It helps us identify if we are regressing one variable on another almost identical to itself. All variables are close to 1, therefore multivollinearity does not exist.\n\nCross-Validation\nModel Selection with GLMSelect\nI used Proc GLMSelect in SAS, with AICC as a selection criterion. The first variable selected was Batting Average, then it chose Strikeouts, next it chose Walks. The bold line at 3 indicates that those three variables are the best model for Hits.\n\nQuality of the Fitted Model: Steps for Cross Validation\nI used Cross Validation to judge the quality of the fitted model shown above.\nStep 1: Splitting the Data\nThe first step I took was to split the existing data into two groups. I did this by first randomizing the order of the 246 batters in my data, and then I split them into two groups. The first group, known as the training group, consists of 100 batters and the second group, known as the validation group, consists on 146 batters.\n\nStep 2: Fit the Regression Model\nNow I fit the regression model on the training sample.\n\nStep 3: Out of Sample Forecasting\nNext, I used the resulting  equation to forecast the number of hits for the Validation Sample. Below, I have shown the last 10 observations of the yhat equation Validation Sample.\n\nStep 4: Compare MSE values\nIn order to measure the quality of fit, we need to compare the Internal MSE (MSE for the training sample) with the External MSE (MSE for the validation sample). If the training MSE and the validation MSE are similar in value, then we can say that this is evidence for validating the chosen model.\n\nSince, the slope estimates are computed in such a fashion as to minimize the Internal MSE, we must expect that the External MSE will be larger than the Internal MSE. We can use the following equation to account for how much larger the External MSE will be from the internal MSE:\n(n+p)/(n-p)=  (246+4)/(246-4)=  250/242= 1.033\nNow, I can compare that with the Internal and External MSE:\n(External MSE)/(Internal MSE)=  539.5/389.806=1.384\nThey seem to be close in value, therefore the model has been validated.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Gindely', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 8, 2020', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Updated Jan 12, 2021', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '2 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/renatomir', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 8, 2020', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Updated Jan 12, 2021', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020']}"

You'll also use your model to make a prediction about new data!\nObjectives\nYou will be able to:\n\nPerform a linear regression using self-constructed functions\nInterpret the parameters of a simple linear regression model in relation to what they signify for specific data\n\nLet's get started\nThe best-fit line's slope $\\hat m$ can be calculated as:\n$$\\hat m = \\rho \\frac{S_Y}{S_X}$$\nWith $\\rho$ being the correlation coefficient and ${S_Y}$ and ${S_X}$ being the standard deviation of $x$ and $y$, respectively. It can be shown that this is also equal to:\n$$\\hat m = \\dfrac{\\overline{x}*\\overline{y}-\\overline{xy}}{(\\overline{x})^2-\\overline{x^2}}$$\nYou'll use the latter formula in this lab. First, break down the formula into its parts. To do this, you'll import the required libraries and define some data points to work with. Next, you'll use some pre-created toy data in NumPy arrays. Let's do this for you to give you a head start.\n# import necessary libraries\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import style\nstyle.use('ggplot')\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Initialize arrays X and Y with given values\n# X = Independent Variable\nX = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,8,8,9,10], dtype=np.float64)\n# Y = Dependent Variable\nY = np.array([7,7,8,9,9,10,10,11,11,12], dtype=np.float64)\nCreate a scatter plot of X and Y and comment on the output\n# Scatter plot\n# Your observations about the relationship between X and Y \n\n\n\n#\nWrite a function calc_slope()\nWrite a function calc_slope() that takes in X and Y and calculates the slope using the formula shown above.\n# Write the function to calculate slope as: \n# (mean(x) * mean(y) – mean(x*y)) / ( mean (x)^2 – mean( x^2))\ndef calc_slope(xs,ys):\n    \n    pass\n\ncalc_slope(X,Y)\n\n# 0.5393518518518512\nGreat, so we have our slope. Next we calculate the intercept.\nAs a reminder, the calculation for the best-fit line's y-intercept is:\n$$\\hat c = \\overline y - \\hat m \\overline x $$\nWrite a function best_fit()\nWrite a function best_fit() that takes in X and Y, calculates the slope and intercept using the formula. The function should return slope and intercept values.\n# use the slope function with intercept formula to return calculate slope and intercept from data points\n\ndef best_fit(xs,ys):\n    \n    pass\n\n# Uncomment below to test your function\n\n#m, c = best_fit(X,Y)\n#m, c\n\n# (0.5393518518518512, 6.379629629629633)\nWe now have a working model with m and c as model parameters. We can create a line for the data points using the calculated slope and intercept:\n\nRecall that $y = mx + c$. We can now use slope and intercept values along with X data points (features) to calculate the Y data points (labels) of the regression line.\n\nWrite a function reg_line()\nWrite a function reg_line() that takes in slope, intercept and X vector and calculates the regression line using $y= mx + c$ for each point in X\ndef reg_line (m, c, xs):\n    \n    pass\n\n# Uncomment below\n#regression_line = reg_line(m,c,X)\nPlot the (x,y) data points and draw the calculated regression line for visual inspection\n# Plot data and regression line\nSo there we have it, our least squares regression line. This is the best fit line and does describe the data pretty well (still not perfect though).\nDescribe your Model Mathematically and in Words\n# Your answer here\n\n\nPredicting new data\nSo, how might you go about actually making a prediction based on this model you just made?\nNow that we have a working model with m and b as model parameters. We can fill in a value of x with these parameters to identify a corresponding value of $\\hat y$ according to our model. Recall the formula:\n$$\\hat y = \\hat mx + \\hat c$$\nLet's try to find a y prediction for a new value of $x = 7$, and plot the new prediction with existing data\nx_new = 7\ny_predicted = None\ny_predicted\n\n# 10.155092592592592\nPlot the prediction with the rest of the data\n# Plot as above and show the predicted value\nYou now know how to create your own models, which is great! Next, you'll find out how to determine the accuracy of your model!\nSummary\nIn this lesson, you learned how to perform linear regression for data that are linearly related. You first calculated the slope and intercept parameters of the regression line that best fit the data. You then used the regression line parameters to predict the value ($\\hat y$-value) of a previously unseen feature ($x$-value).\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/merb92', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', '2', 'MATLAB', 'Updated Jun 24, 2020']}","{'location': 'New York', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '121 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['classification_regression_tasks\nTask 1 Classification on the ‘credit-g’ dataset (Notebook 1)\nYou can download the dataset with ‘fetch_openml(‘credit_g’)’ and see it’s description at\nhttps://www.openml.org/d/31\n1.1 Determine which features are continuous and which are categorical.\n1.2 Visualize the univariate distribution of each continuous feature, and the distribution of the\ntarget.\n1.3 Split data into training and test set.

This excludes paid leave and occasions where an employer has granted an employee time off.\nThis task will address Absenteeism at a company during work time.\nProblem: Business environment nowadays is more competitive than it used to be. This lead to increased pressure in the workplace. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that unachievable business goals and an elevated risk of unemployment can raise people's stress levels. Often, the continuous presence of such factors becomes detrimental to a person's health. Sometimes this may result in minor illness which of course is not desired. However, it may happen that the employee develops a long-term condition. An example being depression.\nLooking at predicting absenteeism from work.\nWe would like to know whether or not an employee can be expected to be missing for a specific number of hours in a given work day.\nHaving such information in advance can improve our decision-making. How? by re-organizing the work process in a way that will allow us to avoid a lack of productivity and increase the quality of work generated in our firm.\nLogically here come some additional questions based on what information should we predict whether an employee is expected to be absent or not.\nHow would we measure absenteeism?\nShould we rather think about trying to predict excessive absenteeism?\nJust remember that as a whole the purpose of the business task will be to explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not.\nIn other words, we want to know for how many working hours an employee could be away from work based on information such as how far they live from their workplace? How many children and pets they have? Do they have higher education? and so on.\nVisualization and insight\nAge vs Probability\n\nFrom the figure, we can clearly see that employees with age 40 years and below absent from work for more three hours.\nFor instance, there's a 59 percent chance that an employee who is 28 years will be absent from work for more than three hours.\nReason vs Probability\n\nWe can see all reasons contain data for both values 0 and 1 except for reason 2.\nNone of the employees (from our 40 observations) were away from work. For this reason, it is removed from the analysis since it provides less information on our dataset.\nIf a person is supposed to be absent due to a reason from Group 1 as marked by the dots associated with the value of 1 the probability that she will be excessively absent is above 50 percent.\nHence such an individual is expected to be away from work for more than three hours whereas when we look at a Reason 3 we must consider the very few observations of people who had specified this reason for excessive absence as well as the fact that the probabilities have been distributed both in the lower and upper parts of the vertical line.\nThat's why we could say that.\nSimilarly, to reason 2 this class doesn't tell us much about what to expect from individuals being absent because of a reason from Group 3.\nFinally reason 4 leads us to an opposite conclusion compared to reason one.\nThe people who are absent because of reason 4 absence exhibit a probability below 50 percent to be excessively absent.\nAnd now if we want to extend our analysis by adding a qualitative interpretation of the results what should we say for groups 1 and 4? Do our numerical inferences match any business logic and can they have a more intuitive explanation?\nThe reasons included in group 1 without disrespecting all other reasons the ones we have here represent very serious diseases. That's why the numbers tell us that the expected probability of an individual to be excessively absent because of a reason from this class is higher than 50 percent.\nHow about group 4?\nIt represents what we've called less-serious reasons for absence a dental appointment, physiotherapy, a medical consultation and others.\nWhen you think of it is quite probable that none of these could be serious enough to require that a person is absent from their workplace for an entire day. That's why the numbers show that people who have to be absent for such a reason are not expected to be excessively absent as you can see the probability values are all below the mark of 50 percent.\nTransportation Expense and Children\n\nWe would like to see the probability that a person will be excessively absent from work in relation to the transportation expense they must cover each month as well as to the number of children they have.\nAlthough loosely we could say that there is a positive correlation. Perhaps if we were given a data set containing more observations this correlation would have been stronger.\nThen we could say with certainty that the higher the transportation expenses of a person the higher the chance they will be away from work excessively good.\nLooking at the data further, it turns out people with no children don't exhibit a high probability for excessive absence. Also aside from one small exception none of them have high transportation expenses.\nPerhaps there is nothing that would induce these people live further away from their working place.\nWe have a lot more data in this case (1 child) the probability that this group is expected to be excessively absent varies across observations. However, most of the data is clustered around the average transportation expense spending between $220 and $240 a month.\nWhat about people with two children?\nIf we disregard the values clustered around the centre the distribution is similar. Thus we could say that our data is about people who don't generally spend more than $240 on transportation. Only 5 observations lay beyond this cut-off line.\nJust one individual has 3 children. In other words, this category can't really affect the analysis of the 40 observations we have. Therefore, it is excluded from the analysis.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/FedoAIworld', 'info_list': ['Cuda', 'Updated Oct 7, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 24, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Feb 1, 2021', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020']}","{'location': 'NSUTA-GHANA', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '6 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/aadadzie', 'info_list': ['Cuda', 'Updated Oct 7, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 24, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Feb 1, 2021', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020']}","{'location': 'Ha Noi', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '135 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition\nUsing Softmax Regression, Softmax Regression with shallow neural network and deep neural network\nHow to use\n\n\nOpen MNIST.ipynb to train model and predict your image\n\n\nConvolutional_Model.ipynb - Implement sobel convolutional and rebuild AlexNet, VGG16, VGG11 architecture\n\n\nResnet.ipynb - Rebuild AlexNet, VGG16, VGG11 arch\n\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/ducviet00', 'info_list': ['Cuda', 'Updated Oct 7, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 24, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Feb 1, 2021', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '69 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Regression-and-Gradient-Descent-Algorithm\nsingle and multivariate regression analysis and application of gradient descent algorithm\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/AYSE-DUMAN', 'info_list': ['Cuda', 'Updated Oct 7, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 24, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Feb 1, 2021', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '242 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['cell-counting\nDeeply supervised density regression for automatic cell counting in microscopy images\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/shenghh2015', 'info_list': ['Cuda', 'Updated Oct 7, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 24, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Feb 1, 2021', '2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020']}","{'location': 'brighton, United Kingdom', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '46 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Car-Price-Prediction-Linear-Regression\nProblem Statement\nThis assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of car prices.

It may be useful to study these factors, however the first step is to study the number of cases and deaths over time.\nObjectives:\xa0\n\nAnalyze the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths by U.S. state over time\nCalculate COVID-19 mortality rate by state\nCreate a tool that will quickly visualize the data using tables and charts\nAllow user to search by either state or date and sort data by columns\nAllow user to plot the data and fit a linear regression model\nCalculate R-squared value\n\nLibraries used:\n\npandas for data preparation\nnumpy for data manipulation\nmatplotlib for data visualization\nsklearn for statistical modeling\n\nR-squared value meaning:\nThe Rsquared value, or correlation of determination, explains how closely correlated the dependent value (cases) is with the independent value (deaths). As the number of cases increases, the number of deaths to the virus should increase as well. It may be useful to study how linear this relationship is.\nDatasource (updated daily):\nhttps://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-states.csv\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/paulmarinos', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'R', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 28, 2021', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Dec 23, 2019']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '16 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['LinearRegressionModel\nSimple Linear Regression Model using Tensorflow 2.0 in Python\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/ssubbyun', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'R', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jan 28, 2021', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Dec 23, 2019']}"

It's main purpose is to predic the price of a house based on the number of rooms in the house, the relative poverty percentage in the house's neighborhood and the average class size, represented as the pupil-teacher ratio. The regressor used here is a Decision Tree regressor.\nThere is also some data analaysis performed near the beginning of the script, to give a brief overview of the data its distribution and correlations, as well as some information about the nature of the models being used. The Model Learning and Model Complexity graphs are used for model analysis and are generated from functions in the visuals file. They give a description of how the model predictive power changes as a function of kew Decision Tree parameters (in this case the max depth is the parameter being principally examined).\nWhen the Model Learning script is run, some warning will appear. Also, for the Model Learning graphs, there is no traning score for the oth training size. This is purely due to the inability of the regressor to provide score for null traning points, and is nothing to be concerned aboout.\nFor the error analysis, a function from the aforementioned visuals file is used to run the prediction 10 times using variable random states and the variance calculated. This nicely describes the models' sensitivity in both monetary and percentage terms.\nTo run the prediction algorithm simply use import and make sure to have all the dependencies (the data and the visuals file) saved in the same directory. All libraries used here are fairly standard.\nThis algorithm was adapated from a towardsdatascience article by Victor Roman (the URL is available below). The article is rather brief and bereft of detail, and significant research had to be done to figure out why parts of the instructions didn't work. All the relevant material is available in the article links, and apart from some minor design details little revision was required.\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-project-predicting-boston-house-prices-with-regression-b4e47493633d\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/MrFlygerian', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Apr 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'R', 'Updated May 9, 2020', 'Updated Aug 24, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'Updated May 8, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jul 25, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Julia', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020']}","{'location': 'Stanford, CA', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '15 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Mixed_Category_Regression_AI\nUsing Keras/TensorFlow Deep Learning Network, we demonstrate how to perform regression when the input data consists of both continuous and categorical variables.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/melindazhu', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Apr 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'R', 'Updated May 9, 2020', 'Updated Aug 24, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'Updated May 8, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jul 25, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Julia', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020']}","{'location': 'Ithaca, NY', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '563 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Project: Regression Modeling with the Boston Housing Dataset\nIntroduction\nIn this lab, you\'ll apply the regression analysis and diagnostics techniques covered in this section to the ""Boston Housing"" dataset.

Dealing with outliers, normalizing data, scaling values etc. can help regression analysis get more meaningful results from the given data.\n\nAdvanced Analytical Methods\n\nSimple regression is a very basic analysis technique and trying to fit a straight line solution to complex analytical questions may prove to be very inefficient. Later on, you\'ll explore multiple regression where you can use multiple features at once to define a relationship with the outcome. You\'ll also look at some preprocessing and data simplification techniques and revisit the Boston dataset with an improved toolkit.\nLevel up - Optional\nApply some data wrangling skills that you have learned in the previous section to pre-process the set of independent variables we chose above. You can start off with outliers and think of a way to deal with them. See how it affects the goodness of fit.\nSummary\nIn this lab, you applied your skills learned so far on a new data set. You looked at the outcome of your analysis and realized that the data might need some preprocessing to see a clear improvement in the results. You\'ll pick this back up later on, after learning about more preprocessing techniques and advanced modeling techniques.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/merb92', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Apr 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'R', 'Updated May 9, 2020', 'Updated Aug 24, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'Updated May 8, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jul 25, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Julia', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020']}","{'location': 'Mumbai', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '264 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/FarheenB', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Apr 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'R', 'Updated May 9, 2020', 'Updated Aug 24, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'Updated May 8, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jul 25, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Julia', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020']}"

In linear regression, it is assumed that the data are related by a linear model y=βx+e, where β is the regression coefficient and e is Gaussian noise. By generating many datasets where there is no relationship between X and Y (β = 0) and fitting a line to each simulation, it is possible to estimate the likelihood of seeing the relationship generated by scipy.optimize.curve_fit in the original dataset by chance. The regression coefficient for the given dataset is compared to a distribution of regression coefficients from running many simulations. Two different distributions are created for comparison. The first involves best-fit lines of completely new generated datasets, while the second involves generating new datasets through bootstrapping. The regression coefficient from cipy.optimize.curve_fit is shown to be almost equal to the median regression coefficent from the distribution. Finally, a distribution of residuals from the original best-fit line created by scipy.optimize.curve_fit is created. This distribution is found to somewhat follow a normal distribution.\nMethods\nFirst, scipy.optimize.curve_fit is used to form a best-fit line for the original dataset. The output covariance of the fit is used to determine the 95% confidence interval in the slope of the fitted line. Then, 1000 new datasets with no relationship between X and Y are generated. The values in each dataset are randomly picked between the lower and upper bounds of x- and y-values from the original dataset. A distribution of regression coefficients is created from these new datasets and used to evaluate the probability of obtaining the scipy.optimize.curve_fit result from the original dataset. This process of generating new datasets, fitting a line to each dataset, and comparing the distribution of slopes to the original result is repeated. However, this time the new datasets are generated through bootstrapping. The original data is resampled with replacement to create 1000 new datasets. The 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrapped distribution are calculated, so that 95% of the regression coefficients fall between these two values. This range is used to compare to the 95% confidence interval in the regression coefficient of the original dataset.\nIn addition to regression coefficients, the residuals are also evaluated. The residuals are calculated by subtracting the original data from the scipy.optimize.curve_fit fitted model. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used to determine how well the distribution of residuals follows a normal distribution.\nResults and Discussion\nThe regression coefficient found by scipy.optimize.curve_fit is: 0.0741\nThe 95% confidence interval in the fitted slope of the line is: [0.0457, 0.102]\nThe distribution of regression coefficients from datasets generated randomly indicates that the likelihood of seeing a relationship with slope greater than or equal to the best-fit coefficient of the original dataset is 6.60%. However, bootstrapping is perhaps a better way to assess confidence in the scipy.optimize.curve_fit results. When comparing to the distribution of regression coefficients of bootstrapped datasets, the likelihood of seeing a regression coefficient less than or equal to the best-fit coefficient of the original dataset is 48.30%. These results are shown below in Figure 1.\n\nThe median regression coefficient from the distribution of bootstrapped datasets is: 0.0733\nThe 2.5th percentile is: 0.0234\nThe 97.5th percentile is: 0.122\nFigure 2 shows how these values compare to the scipy.optimize.curve_fit best-fit of the original dataset. As seen below, it appears as though the scipy.optimize.curve_fit best-fit line and the line using the median regression coefficient from the bootstrapped datasets are almost equal. However, the bootstrapped model has a greater confidence interval. This makes sense considering the wide spread of the data.\n\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic is: 0.268\nThe probability of observing residuals is: 7.673e-07\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic suggests that the normal distribution is an 'okay' though not great fit for the residuals. The probability of observing residuals is extremely low, which may explain the deviation from what is expected.\nFigure 3 shows the distribution of residuals.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/shoshireich', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Feb 3, 2021', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020']}","{'location': 'Lahore, Pakistan', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '132 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Linear-regression\nThis project uses a dummy artificial dataset of Ecommerce customers and sklearn is used to implement linear regression on it.

A Machine Learning Model.\nCan we predict the number of people visiting a certain city by using Machine Learning Techniques? can we predict the reasons behind that decision? According to the world economic forum, the rise in the number of megacities is the most visible evidence of the accelerating global trend towards urbanization. In 1950, cities were home to 751 million people, less than one-third of the global population. Just two (New York and Tokyo) had more than 10 million inhabitants. Today, 55% of us live in urban areas – that’s 4.2 billion people. In another generation, that proportion is set to grow to 68%, potentially adding another 2.5 billion people to already crowded cities.\nBut what is it the reason that people seek when moving, visiting, or relocating to another city? Is it a good economy? is it the culture? maybe the social rights, or the crime rates, real estate affordability, LGBT+ rights or even average net salary? The fact is that there are a lot and a lot of factors that people can take into consideration when moving to another city for tourism, business or even to study.\nThrough this Article I will try to produce a prediction model using Python to predict and forecast cities demand and finding the causal effect relationship between different variables. I will be building a dataset from scratch and experimenting some ideas with regression models. This dataset includes official data collected from different sources such as Eurostat, Istat, Statista, World Bank, Government platforms, Teleport, OECD, and Numbeo. The data will be exploring a sample of 42 cities ranked by 13 selected variables.\nThe data will be tested for correlation to measure if those variables have a relationship with the number of people visiting a certain city each year, and to also measure if we can predict the numbers of people visiting a city throughout those variables. We will be measuring how those variables are in relationship with each other. A regression analysis will be implemented, both linear simple regression and multiple linear regression, a prediction model will be produced based on the data and evaluated with different methodologies.\nThe variables we selected to compare against the Visitors yearly numbers are as following: Visitors to locals ratio, Employment, GDP, GDP per capita, Population, Foreign Population, Land area (km2), Medium Size City Center Apartment Rent, AVG Net Salary, Air Quality score, Urban Greenery score, Life Expectancy and number of Startups.\nThe selected cities are all from within the European union, they were chosen due to similar regulation, similar polices and easy travel between them. The selected cities are: Paris, London, Milano, Madrid, Munich, Berlin, Barcelona, Stockholm, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Roma, Amsterdam, Stuttgart, Brussel, Vienna, Dublin, Napoli, Budapest, Lisbon, Oslo, Lyon, Copenhagen, Leeds, Rotterdam, Zürich, Helsinki, Manchester, Prague, Antwerp, Porto, Utrecht, Bordeaux, Bilbao, Eindhoven, Basel, Liverpool, Genève, Nice, Firenze, Riga, Vilnius, Tallinn.\nLet's get started.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/YasserElsedawy', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 21, 2020', 'Updated Aug 24, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 18, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020']}","{'location': 'San Francisco', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '36 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Linear-Regression-\nR Markdown file containing practice problems in Data Visualization focused on Linear Regression\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Chasesinclair1', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 21, 2020', 'Updated Aug 24, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 18, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020']}","{'location': 'Mumbai', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '46 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/DhruvDRE', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 21, 2020', 'Updated Aug 24, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 18, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': 'NONE', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Intelligent-Systems-Phystech', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 21, 2020', 'Updated Aug 24, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 18, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020']}","{'location': 'Nashik', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '71 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Nilayy7', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 21, 2020', 'Updated Aug 24, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 18, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020']}","{'location': 'Warsaw', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '102 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Simple script that creates nonlinear regression model, made in around 1h to help my friend at college.\nFunction that I found, which fits given data set, was f(x)= a*(x-b)**2 + c\nso the point was to optimize parameters a, b, c.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/mzakonek', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 21, 2020', 'Updated Aug 24, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 18, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020']}"

The data will be exploring a sample of 42 cities ranked by 13 selected variables.\nThe data will be tested for correlation to measure if those variables have a relationship with the number of people visiting a certain city each year, and to also measure if we can predict the numbers of people visiting a city throughout those variables. We will be measuring how those variables are in relationship with each other. A regression analysis will be implemented, both linear simple regression and multiple linear regression, a prediction model will be produced based on the data and evaluated with different methodologies.\nThe variables we selected to compare against the Visitors yearly numbers are as following: Visitors to locals ratio, Employment, GDP, GDP per capita, Population, Foreign Population, Land area (km2), Medium Size City Center Apartment Rent, AVG Net Salary, Air Quality score, Urban Greenery score, Life Expectancy and number of Startups.\nThe selected cities are all from within the European union, they were chosen due to similar regulation, similar polices and easy travel between them. The selected cities are: Paris, London, Milano, Madrid, Munich, Berlin, Barcelona, Stockholm, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Roma, Amsterdam, Stuttgart, Brussel, Vienna, Dublin, Napoli, Budapest, Lisbon, Oslo, Lyon, Copenhagen, Leeds, Rotterdam, Zürich, Helsinki, Manchester, Prague, Antwerp, Porto, Utrecht, Bordeaux, Bilbao, Eindhoven, Basel, Liverpool, Genève, Nice, Firenze, Riga, Vilnius, Tallinn.\nLet's get started.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/YasserElsedawy', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 21, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated May 3, 2020', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020']}","{'location': 'Greater Noida, UP', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '176 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Linear-Regression\nIn statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables).

It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.\nIt performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x).

The code will fail to scrape the financials page from the website and fail.\nI want to describe the project I recently completed. I used Python to web-scrape a great deal of financial data from the stock market to perform a statistical analysis of stocks I will consider adding to my personal investment portfolio. My Python program scans and filters hundreds of thousands of rows of data, assigns a weighted score system, and returns to me with the top 20 stocks. The score system is predominantly a modified linear regression slope of the last 90 days of closing prices. I will briefly describe what I did.\nTo start I scan over 20,000 stocks on GuruFocus.com to gather all stocks between $15 and $100. Because I do not have that much money in my portfolio, I try to diversify as best I can by having low cost stocks.\nI then take each stock to Yahoo Finance and plug the ticker into its server. Many of the securities on GuruFocus are not exactly 'real' and have little to no information on Yahoo Finance, so I remove these from my data frame.\nNext, I take the filtered stocks and I collect price information on each stock from Yahoo Finance. I collect 90 days of open prices, close prices, the daily high, low, and the volume. In total I have over 284,000 rows of stock data in my data frame at this point. I keep my data temporarily stored in a pipe-delimited CSV file as I move from function to function in my Python script. That way if my code stops or has an issue getting a response from a server I can pick back up where I left off after re-starting my code.\nThen I perform another level of screening. Using the data I collected on volumes, I find the mean volume and standard deviation for each of the stocks over the 90 day period. I find the Z-score of every stock and I filter-out any stock with a Z-score below a certain threshold (I keep tweaking it to get the best results).\nNow that I've performed my last filtration I begin a new statistical analysis to assign my scores. At this point I have well over 50,000 stocks to look at. I get the linear regression slope of the last 90 days' closing prices. A relatively 'high' slope will mean the price has been trending upward the last 90 days. I tend to go with short-term trading as my personal investing strategy, so I only look at the recent past, then I will buy a stock with the intention to hold it for a few weeks at a minimum before I sell it.\nI modify the linear regression slope by multiplying it by the r-squared value. The r-squared value is the correlation coefficient squared, which basically tells how well data points fit a regression line. The correlation coefficient and r-squared will help tell if the regression line has any explanatory power. Because the r-squared value has a maximum of one, when I multiply the slope by the r-squared value I effectively discount the slope of any regression lines with little explanatory power (if the r-squared value is miraculously 1 then the slope is maintained after being multiplied by 1). Thus I modify the slope to give lower scores to stocks with data that doesn't trend well.\nMy weighted score system is heavily focused on the modified regression slope. The modified slope is 85% of the score. The remaining 15% is a modified average revenue change over the past four years of the publicly traded company. What I do is get the year to year change in revenue over four years and average the change. I modify this value to smooth out the radical shifts in some companies' revenue and I discount any company that has less than four years of revenue history. Without getting into too much detail, I basically discount any radical upward swings in revenue. If a company's revenue fell by 90% then the absolute number of this change is .9. There are some companies who can more than triple, quadruple, and multiply one years revenue the next year by great numbers. So the maximum fall in revenue is -1, but the rise can be times 10 or even more.

So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). \n     The equation has the form Y= a + bX, where Y is the dependent variable (that's the variable that goes on the Y axis), X is the independent variable (i.e. it is plotted on the X axis), b is the slope of the line and a is the y-intercept.A regression line is a straight line that describes how a response variable y changes as an explanatory variable x changes.

We also need some additional information outside of the model.\n\n\nZach lost the email that told us where these properties were located. Ugh, Zach :-/. Because property taxes are assessed at the county level,\nwe would like to know what states and counties these are located in.\n\n\nWe\'d also like to know the distribution of tax rates for each county.\n\n\nThe data should have the tax amounts and tax value of the home, so it shouldn\'t be too hard to calculate. Please include in your report to us the\ndistribution of tax rates for each county so that we can see how much they vary within the properties in the county and the rates the bulk of the\nproperties sit around.\n\n\nNote that this is separate from the model you will build, because if you use tax amount in your model, you would be using a future data point to\npredict a future data point, and that is cheating! In other words, for prediction purposes, we won\'t know tax amount until we know tax value.\n\nExecutive Summary:\n\n\nI found that bathroom square footage and total property square footage were two of the most important features when it came to calculating tax assessed home value. The key insight is that the target variable is not ""market house price"" (i.e not what the seller would value their house), but rather what the county values the property as for tax purposes. This means that the focus needs to be on features that tax assessors look for when evaluating properties, and number of bathrooms, as well as bathroom count, are key features because they are a good indicator of the property\'s quality. Number of bedrooms is not always as reliable, because this is a key driver of market value, which leads to many homeowners to create smaller bedrooms to inflate this metric.\n\nA successful model was created using bedroom square feet, bathroom square feet, and total square feet (excluding bathroom and bedroom square footage). These features were engineered using the data and domain knowledge to help reduce the dependency that the original features share, which was leading a skew in the model.\n\n\n\nFurther improvements:\n\nTo improve the model, we would need more features that are important to tax assessors, such as:\n\nLocation: While latitude and longitude is avialable in the data, any useful analysis would require a clustering algorithms to group locations of higher value, and currently this is not possible.\nQuality features: Garage square footage, pool size, number of fireplaces, etc. These are factors that tax assessors are more likely to look at, rather than bedroom count, because they are a better representation of the quality of the property. Unfortunately, the data available has a lot of null values for all of these categories, which makes them unsable for the model.\n\n\n\nRequirements to access report:\n\n\nTo access the full report, the repo needs to be cloned, along with all the .py files.\n\n\nDue to the size of the data, the report pulls the data from a SQL database. In order to get access to the data, and the report, an env.py file will need to be present in the same directory that the files are cloned to, and the file needs to have the following variables:\nuser = username information for the sql database\nhost = host number\npassword = password.\nThe wrangle.py file will look for the env.py file to access the SQL database and pull the data. A new file csv file will then be created and stored in the same directory for future use.\n\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/guedanie', 'info_list': ['Assembly', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '413 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['회귀분석 프로젝트\n\nDacon - AI프렌즈 시즌1 온도 추정 경진 대회\n\n\n팀원: 양준, 오진경, 윤예슬, 이희재\n\n\n1. 데이터 설명\n\n\n\n대전지역에서 측정한 실내외 19곳의 센서데이터와 주변 지역의 기상청 공공데이터를 semi-비식별화하여 제공합니다.\n\n\n센서는 온도를 측정하였습니다.\n\n\n모든 데이터는 시간 순으로 정렬 되어 있으며 10분 단위 데이터 입니다.\n\n\n예측 대상(target variable)은 Y18입니다.\n\n\ntrain.csv\n\n30일 간의 기상청 데이터 (X00 - X39) 및 센서데이터 (Y00 - Y17)\n이후 3일 간의 기상청 데이터 (X00 - X39) 및 센서데이터 (Y18)\n\n\n\ntest.csv\n\ntrain.csv 기간 이후 80일 간의 기상청 데이터 (X00 - X39)\n\n\n\n2. 데이터 전처리 & 분석 과정\n\n\n3.결과\n\nMSE 3.94, 상위 11%(총 378명 참가)\n\n4.프로젝트 결과물\n회귀분석프로젝트.pdf\n5. 분석에 필요한 패키지\n\nrequirements.txt\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/DS-Heejae', 'info_list': ['Assembly', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020']}","{'location': 'New Delhi', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '36 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/gaurab2455', 'info_list': ['Assembly', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '54 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Linear_And_Logistic_Regression\nIn Titanic dataset , Implement the logistic regression and find aout the Accuracy of model\nImplementing Logistic Regression\nsteps\n1) Collecting data\n2) Analysing Data\n3) Data Wrangling\n4) Train & test\n5) Accuracy check\nAnd in Suv dataset , simply check the accuracy\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/9717', 'info_list': ['Assembly', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020']}","{'location': 'Germany', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '44 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Bayesian_regression_pyro\nThis repo contains working examples MCMC and SVI models for bayesian regression using the pyro library.

In this assignment we will explore linear models and compare different methods of learning linear classifiers and regression functions. The following methods have been implemented across the problems.\n\nLinear regression\nLogistic regression\nOne vs Rest classification\nOne hot classification\n\nProblem 1 deals with implementing and evaluating linear and logistic regressions with synthetic data drawn from Gamma, Uniform and Normal distributions. Problem 2 deals with classification using the Iris dataset with three 2-class classifiers using ‘one vs rest’ strategy and with a 3-class linear classifier (by taking the target variable as a 3-dimensional one-hot vector). Problems 3 deals with classification using German credit data using linear least squares and logistic regression. Problem 4 deals with an 1D regression with polynomial fitting.\nBuilt With\nThis project was built with\n\npython v3.7\nThe list of libraries used for developing this project is available at requirements.txt.\n\nGetting Started\nClone the repository into a local machine using\ngit clone https://github.com/vineeths96/Linear-classifiers-and-Regression\nPrerequisites\nPlease install required libraries by running the following command (preferably within a virtual environment).\npip install -r requirements.txt\nInstructions to run\nThere are four python files - problem_1.py, problem_2.py, problem_3.py , and problem_4.py - each corresponding to the particular problem in the Problem Statement.

Motivation is a key factor in losing one\'s objectivity, so it would seem the feedback they receive would be fraught with \'he said / she said\' data and customer complaints.  It\'s easy to envision a trend where the more feedback they got, the further buyer and seller data would diverge from each other.\nSecondly, foreclosures are not factored into the algorithm, whereas variables like \'area home sale price\' are.  Anyone who has driven through neighborhoods with a foreclosed property(properties) knows that property values surrounding those foreclosures are diminished, at least from a buyer\'s perspective.  Their reasoning for not including foreclosures is that they are outliers.  While that may be true under normal conditions, Zillow was founded in 2006 - two years before the tremendously non-normal condition of the 2008 housing crash.   An increase in foreclosures (say, for the city of Detroit) would push outliers closer to - and possibly within - the normal distribution curve.\nOnce my Minimum Viable Product is satisfactory, I would like to explore possible feature engineering that includes these and other factors I discovered while looking into the cached project deliverables.\nFull disclosure on my process:\nNaturally, the data science pipeline / workflow is implemented, but I\'m a bit \'old-school\' and need to touch and feel my information.  I have printed out the necessary modules for my own reference, as well as whiteboarded all objectives, complete with Post-It notes of various colors to physically keep track of my progress.\nMost of the dataframe coding and visualizations have been done using Jupyter Notebooks, an awesome and easy-to-use development environment, especially for people like me who tend to think out loud.  In the notebooks are comments that range from snippet to tome - the decision to keep them in there is to show my thinking process throughout each phase of the project.\nImports and this README file are rooted in VSCode.  Previous python-ing had been performed in PyCharm in preparation for this course and Jupyter Notebooks during this course, so when perusing my code in VS, one may find some noob-like stylings.\nBut, hey: as long as the functions work, right?\nMinimum Viable Product\nAt the very least, we are to use our modeling to predict single-unit property values using only three factors: the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, and the overall square footage.  From this spec, I will attempt to reject the following three null-hypotheses:\nNumber of Bedrooms\n\n\n$H_0$ - The number of bedrooms is not a driver of single-unit property values.\n\n\n($H_a$ - The number of bedrooms IS a driver of single-unit property values)\n\n\nNumber of Bathrooms\n\n\n$H_0$ - The number of bathrooms is not a driver of single-unit property values\n\n\n($H_a$ - The number of bathrooms IS a driver of single_unit properties)\n\n\nSquare Footage\n\n\n$H_0$ - Square footage does not drive single-unit property values\n\n\n($H_a$ - Square footage DOES INDEED drive singe-unit property values)\n\n\nTending to null values in the dataset\nInitial exploration of the data revealed some null values in the features \'square_feet\' and \'tax_amount.\'  It is not believed that these 25 values will have any significant affect on the projection of the remaining non-null variables (totaling 15,011), so these rows will be dropped altogether from our analysis.\nGlossary of Terms\nSeveral features in the provided data needed some clarification for me.  While not exhaustive, this is the segment in which I hope to keep track of their definitions:\nfips number / code\n\nshort for Federal Information Processing Standard\nit\'s a unique identifier for US counties / county equivalents\ncomposed of five numbers: first two are the state code, and the last three digits are the county code\nour database lists them as four-number codes; this is due to the first number being the placeholder zero(0)\n(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_county_code)\n\nRecursive Feature Elimination\nA method of removing features of low importance to reduce model complexity and overfitting.  Not every feature (independent variable, or X value) is as important to the model as the next, and this method of \'feature herd thinning\' iterates through the model, selecting the attributes that best predict the target variable (the y, or \'home_value\', in this case).\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/nickjoseph210', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated May 28, 2020', 'C#', 'Updated Jun 2, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 15, 2020']}","{'location': 'Minnesota', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '430 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Applied Regression Analysis\n\nTOC\n{:toc}\n\nRead in csv files\n\nSet working directory that contains the interested csv file\ndat<-read.csv(""test.csv"")\n\nBasics of dataframe\nA dataframe can be created from vectors, each containing a particular feature for all examples.\nx<-c(1, 2, 3)  # feature x of all 3 examples\ny<-c(5.5, 6.1, 231)  # feature y of all 3 examples\nz<-c(4, 7, 8)  # feature z of all 3 examples\n\ndf<-data.frame(x, y, z)  # create a dataframe\n\ndf$x  # access the vector (col) ""x"" of the dataframe ""df""\ndf$x<-c(2, 3, 4)  # edit the content of a vector inside a dataframe\nggplot2\nInstall ggplot2\ninstall.packages(""ggplot2"")\nBring ggplot2 to current session\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nPlot a single point (4, 9) using geom_point\nx<-4\ny<-9\ndat<-data.frame(x, y)\nggplot()+geom_point(data=dat, aes(x=x, y=y), size=10, color=""red"")\nMore info on geom_point:\nggplot()+geom_point(data=dat, aes(x=x, y=y), size=10, color=""red"")\n\ngeom_point: geometry for plotting points\n\ndata: dataframe that contains data\naes\n\nx=x: x values come from the x vector\ny=y: y values come from the y vector\n\n\nsize: size of each point on plot\ncolor: color of each point on plot\n\nhttp://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf\n\n\nshape: shape of each point on plot, given by integers\n\nhttp://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/shape\n\n\n\n\n\nControl axis limits\nggplot()+\n\tgeom_point(data=dat, aes(x=x, y=y), size=10, color=""red"")+\n\tscale_x_continuous(limits=c(-10, 30))+\n\tscale_y_continuous(limits=c(-20, 80))\nPlot multiple points\nPlot point (2, 6), (5, 4) and (1, 9):\nx<-c(2, 5, 1)\ny<-c(6, 4, 9)\ndat<-data.frame(x, y)\nggplot()+geom_point(data=dat, aes(x=x, y=y), size=10, color=""red"")\nGraph line from endpoints\nPlot line from (1, 3) to (8, 10); plot line from (-2, 13) to (7, -5).\nx<-c(1, 8)\nx<-c(3, 10)\ndat<-data.frame(x, y)\nggplot()+geom_line(data=dat, ase(x=x, y=y))\nGraph line from equation\nGraph $y=3x+1$ where $x\\in[0, 10]$:\nx<-c(0, 10)\nx<-3*x+1\ndat<-data.frame(x, y)\nggplot()+geom_line(data=dat, ase(x=x, y=y))\nSampling from populations\nRandom integer\nsample(1:10, 100, replace=TRUE)  \n# 1st arg: sample from 1 to 10 inclusive\n# 2nd arg: sample 100 points\n# replace: whether to sample with replacement\nNormal populations\nrnorm(100, 50, 10)\n# 1st arg: number of points to sample\n# 2nd arg: mean\n# 3rd arg: standard deviation\nPlot a vertical sample\nx<-rep(1, 100)  # repeat 1 100 times\ny<-rnorm(100, 50, 10)\ndat<-data.frame(x, y)\n\nx<-1\ny<-50\nmean<-data.frame(x, y)\n\nggplot()\n\t+geom_point(data=dat, aes(x=x, y=y))\n\t+geom_point(data=mean, aes(x=x, y=y), size=7, color=""red"")\nPlot several vertical samples\nTask: plot three distinct vertical samples of 100 points each.\n\nSample 1: x=1, mean=50, std=10\nSample 2: x=9, mean=30, std=10\nSample 3: x=15, mean=78, std=10\n\nx<-rep(1, 100)\nx<-c(x, rep(9, 100))\nx<-c(x, rep(15, 100))\n\ny<-rnorm(100, 50, 10)\ny<-c(y, rnorm(100, 30, 10))\ny<-c(y, rnorm(100, 78, 10))\n\ndat<-data.frame(x, y)\n\nx<-c(1, 9, 15)\ny<-c(50, 30, 78)\nmeans<-data.frame(x, y)\n\nggplot()+\n\tgeom_point(data=dat, aes(x=x, y=y))+\n  geom_point(data=means, aes(x=x, y=y), color=""red"")\nSamples along a line\nCreate four vertical samples of 100 points each.

Lets see some real world example\n\nTo predict whether an email is spam (1) or (0)\nWhether the tumour is malignant (1) or not (0)\nIf you are diabetic  (1) or not (0)\n\nConsider a scenario where we need to classify whether an email is spam or not. If we use linear regression for this problem, there is a need for setting up a threshold based on which classification can be done. Say if the actual class is malignant, predicted continuous value 0.4 and the threshold value is 0.5, the data point will be classified as not malignant which can lead to serious consequence in real time.\nFrom this example, it can be inferred that linear regression is not suitable for classification problem. Linear regression is unbounded, and this brings logistic regression into picture. Their value strictly ranges from 0 to 1.\nProject:\nTo make the learning project easier and productive, we are going to learn Logistic Regression by an example of creating a logistic regression model to predict a user is Diabetic or not.\nFirst we are going to collect the dataset and clean it. Then we will create a Logistic regression model with fitting the dataset.\nFileName: diabetic_analysis_logistic_regression.ipynb\nFinally after a successive training it’s our main goal to integrate our machine learning model with the GUIs. You can use tkinter for making a desktop application like we did in Linear Regression example, but here we are going to integrate it with a web framework i.e Flask, to create a website that will take the input parameters from the user and predict if they are Diabetic or not.\nCommand to run the script: python flask_integration\\app.py\n\nHope you have enjoyed learning this, if so share this with others and for more such contents you can connect with me on\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmF8qppe02J1ot4Jfwl_lFg\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagwithyou/\nMedium: https://medium.com/@jagwithyou\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/jagwithyou', 'info_list': ['Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 7, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 18, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '54 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Polynomial_Linear_regression_Positiion_salary\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/aishwarya123mathpati', 'info_list': ['Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 7, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 18, 2020']}","{'location': 'Pune', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '95 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/nimbhorkarnishant', 'info_list': ['Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 7, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 18, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '216 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Movie-review-with-Logistic-Regression\nUsing TF- IDF and Logistic Regression to train model.\nUse Pinline to connect all things together.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/trantntran', 'info_list': ['Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 7, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 18, 2020']}","{'location': 'India', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '48 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Car-Price-Prediction-LinearRegression\nA Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts.\nThey have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends.

Dealing with outliers, normalizing data, scaling values etc. can help regression analysis get more meaningful results from the given data.\n\nAdvanced Analytical Methods\n\nSimple regression is a very basic analysis technique and trying to fit a straight line solution to complex analytical questions may prove to be very inefficient. Later on, you\'ll explore multiple regression where you can use multiple features at once to define a relationship with the outcome. You\'ll also look at some preprocessing and data simplification techniques and revisit the Boston dataset with an improved toolkit.\nLevel up - Optional\nApply some data wrangling skills that you have learned in the previous section to pre-process the set of independent variables we chose above. You can start off with outliers and think of a way to deal with them. See how it affects the goodness of fit.\nSummary\nIn this lab, you applied your skills learned so far on a new data set.

Lab\nIntroduction\nIn this lab, you'll get some hand-on practice developing a simple linear regression model. You'll also use your model to make a prediction about new data!\nObjectives\nYou will be able to:\n\nPerform a linear regression using self-constructed functions\nInterpret the parameters of a simple linear regression model in relation to what they signify for specific data\n\nLet's get started\nThe best-fit line's slope $\\hat m$ can be calculated as:\n$$\\hat m = \\rho \\frac{S_Y}{S_X}$$\nWith $\\rho$ being the correlation coefficient and ${S_Y}$ and ${S_X}$ being the standard deviation of $x$ and $y$, respectively. It can be shown that this is also equal to:\n$$\\hat m = \\dfrac{\\overline{x}*\\overline{y}-\\overline{xy}}{(\\overline{x})^2-\\overline{x^2}}$$\nYou'll use the latter formula in this lab. First, break down the formula into its parts. To do this, you'll import the required libraries and define some data points to work with. Next, you'll use some pre-created toy data in NumPy arrays. Let's do this for you to give you a head start.\n# import necessary libraries\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import style\nstyle.use('ggplot')\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Initialize arrays X and Y with given values\n# X = Independent Variable\nX = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,8,8,9,10], dtype=np.float64)\n# Y = Dependent Variable\nY = np.array([7,7,8,9,9,10,10,11,11,12], dtype=np.float64)\nCreate a scatter plot of X and Y and comment on the output\n# Scatter plot\n# Your observations about the relationship between X and Y \n\n\n\n#\nWrite a function calc_slope()\nWrite a function calc_slope() that takes in X and Y and calculates the slope using the formula shown above.\n# Write the function to calculate slope as: \n# (mean(x) * mean(y) – mean(x*y)) / ( mean (x)^2 – mean( x^2))\ndef calc_slope(xs,ys):\n    \n    pass\n\ncalc_slope(X,Y)\n\n# 0.5393518518518512\nGreat, so we have our slope. Next we calculate the intercept.\nAs a reminder, the calculation for the best-fit line's y-intercept is:\n$$\\hat c = \\overline y - \\hat m \\overline x $$\nWrite a function best_fit()\nWrite a function best_fit() that takes in X and Y, calculates the slope and intercept using the formula. The function should return slope and intercept values.\n# use the slope function with intercept formula to return calculate slope and intercept from data points\n\ndef best_fit(xs,ys):\n    \n    pass\n\n# Uncomment below to test your function\n\n#m, c = best_fit(X,Y)\n#m, c\n\n# (0.5393518518518512, 6.379629629629633)\nWe now have a working model with m and c as model parameters. We can create a line for the data points using the calculated slope and intercept:\n\nRecall that $y = mx + c$. We can now use slope and intercept values along with X data points (features) to calculate the Y data points (labels) of the regression line.\n\nWrite a function reg_line()\nWrite a function reg_line() that takes in slope, intercept and X vector and calculates the regression line using $y= mx + c$ for each point in X\ndef reg_line (m, c, xs):\n    \n    pass\n\n# Uncomment below\n#regression_line = reg_line(m,c,X)\nPlot the (x,y) data points and draw the calculated regression line for visual inspection\n# Plot data and regression line\nSo there we have it, our least squares regression line. This is the best fit line and does describe the data pretty well (still not perfect though).\nDescribe your Model Mathematically and in Words\n# Your answer here\n\n\nPredicting new data\nSo, how might you go about actually making a prediction based on this model you just made?\nNow that we have a working model with m and b as model parameters. We can fill in a value of x with these parameters to identify a corresponding value of $\\hat y$ according to our model. Recall the formula:\n$$\\hat y = \\hat mx + \\hat c$$\nLet's try to find a y prediction for a new value of $x = 7$, and plot the new prediction with existing data\nx_new = 7\ny_predicted = None\ny_predicted\n\n# 10.155092592592592\nPlot the prediction with the rest of the data\n# Plot as above and show the predicted value\nYou now know how to create your own models, which is great! Next, you'll find out how to determine the accuracy of your model!\nSummary\nIn this lesson, you learned how to perform linear regression for data that are linearly related. You first calculated the slope and intercept parameters of the regression line that best fit the data. You then used the regression line parameters to predict the value ($\\hat y$-value) of a previously unseen feature ($x$-value).\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/nadinezab', 'info_list': ['1', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Apr 19, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 9, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 1, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020']}"

We have seen that a decision tree uses a tree structure to predict an output class for a given input example in a classification task. For regression analysis, each path in the tree from the root node to a leaf node represents a decision path that ends in a predicted value. In this lesson, we shall see how regression is performed in using a decision tree regressor using a simple example.\nNote: Kindly visit the official documentation for the regressor tree function used in this lesson.\nObjectives\nYou will be able to:\n\nExplain recursive partitioning\nFit a decision tree regression model with scikit-learn\n\nRecursive partitioning\nLinear regression is considered a global model as there is a single model holding over the entire sample space. For data containing complex features with complicated and nonlinear relations, assembling such a single global model can be a very difficult and computationally expensive task.\nAnother way to handle nonlinear regressions is to partition the sample space into smaller regions, as we have already seen in previous lessons with classification trees. This isn\'t much different in regression. Our goal is partition down to increasingly smaller, simpler subsets until we can fit simple regression models to them. Since each subset is a partition of a smaller subset that is itself a subset, this makes it a textbook example of Recursive Partioning.\nRecall that in classification trees, the leaf nodes (the deepest nodes, or the ones at the end of each particular path) are the ones that contain the purest subsets of the data. Regression trees work a bit differently, but the general idea is still the same. With regression trees, each leaf node of the tree represents a cell of the partition. These cells are the smallest unit where a simple regression can be fit to the data accurately. Splitting the data still works the same way as we saw in previous lessons for classification -- we use our tree model to continuously subset down to smaller, more specific subsets until we reach a level where we can build the simplest regression model to the most specific subset in our data. For example, a regression tree may recursively partition the model down further and further until it gets all customers over the age of 50 residing in Florida with an income over $60k/year, and then fit a simple regression model to only the data points that fit within this specific subset.\nSimple local models\nOne point worth noting is that the simple regression models for each partition aren\'t being used as regressions in real-time. Instead, they take the sample mean of the dependent variable for that partition. Whenever the model makes a prediction, it uses this sample mean rather than calculating the actual regression model. In practice, this works quite well, and has some distinct advantages. Models are easier to interpret, and faster to use for inference (making predictions) since they are just retrieving the stored mean value rather than calculating the actual output of the regression.\nThis is more easily understood when visualized. Consider the regression tree below, which predicts the price of cars based on wheelbase and horsepower:\n\nOnce we have created a decision tree, we can visualize the decision boundaries of that tree (assuming that the dimensionality is small enough for visualization). Notice that all the dividing lines are parallel to the axes because each internal node checks whether a single variable is above or below a given value. In simpler terms, all decision boundaries with decision trees will always be horizontal or vertical if visualized -- there are no diagonal, wavy, or curvy lines, because of the nature of the boolean (true/false) logic used by decision trees to determine the splits!\n\nThe tree correctly represents the interaction between Horsepower and Wheelbase, i.e. when Horsepower > 0.6, Wheelbase no longer matters. When both are equally important, the tree switches between them.\nOnce we train the tree, the local models are completely understood,  so all the effort should go into finding a good partitioning of the data.\nCART training algorithm\nIn this lab, we will focus on the CART algorithm (Classification and Regression Trees) for regression.\n\nThe CART algorithm builds a binary tree in which every non-leaf node has exactly two children (corresponding to a yes/no answer).\n\nGiven a set of training examples and their labels, the algorithm repeatedly splits the training examples $D$ into two subsets $D_{left}, D_{right}$ using some feature set $f$ and feature threshold $t_f$ such that samples with the same label are grouped together.\nAt each node, the algorithm selects the split $\\theta = (f, t_f)$ that produces the smallest mean squared error (MSE) (alternatively, we could use the mean absolute error).\nSo at each step, the algorithm selects the parameters $\\theta$ that minimizes the following cost function:\n\\begin{equation}\nJ(D, \\theta) = \\frac{n_{left}}{n_{total}} MSE_{left} + \\frac{n_{right}}{n_{total}} MSE_{right}\n\\end{equation}\n\n$D$: remaining training examples\n$n_{total}$ : number of remaining training examples\n$\\theta = (f, t_f)$: feature and feature threshold\n$n_{left}/n_{right}$: number of samples in the left/right subset\n$MSE_{left}/MSE_{right}$: MSE of the left/right subset\n\nThis step is repeated recursively until the maximum allowable depth is reached or the current number of samples $n_{total}$ drops below some minimum number. The original equations can be found here.\nAfter building the tree, new examples can be classified by navigating through the tree, testing at each node the corresponding feature until a leaf node/prediction is reached.\nMean Squared Error (MSE)\nWhen performing regression with CART trees (i.e. the target values are continuous) we can evaluate a split using its MSE. The MSE of node $m$ is computed as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\hat{y}m = \\frac{1}{n{m}} \\sum_{i \\in D_m} y_i\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\nMSE_m = \\frac{1}{n_{m}} \\sum_{i \\in D_m} (y_i - \\hat{y}_m)^2\n\\end{equation}\n\n$D_m$: training examples in node $m$\n$n_{m}$ : total number of training examples in node $m$\n$y_i$: target value of $i-$th example\n\nLet\'s see the above in action with a simple experiment. We shall generate some non-linear synthetic data for our X and y attributes and fit it to a regression tree. So let\'s move ahead with this. In order to have a visual understanding of how this works, we shall deal with a simple regression problem between two variables X and y, where y is a simple function of X that we want to learn. Let\'s see this below:\nGenarate data\nRun the cell below to generate the data we will be using in this lesson:\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nplt.style.use(\'seaborn\')\nnp.random.seed(124)\n\n# Generate 100 examples of X and y (a simple cubic function of X) \nX = np.linspace(-3, 3, 100)\ny = X ** 3 + np.random.randn(100)\n\n# Plot the data \nplt.figure(figsize=(15,6))\nplt.scatter(X, y)\nplt.title(""Simple quadratic dataset with noise"")\nplt.xlabel(""Feature values"")\nplt.ylabel(""Target values"")\nplt.show()\n\nLet\'s now create our features and labels, and also perform a 75/25 split for the training and test sets:\nX = X.reshape(-1, 1)\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)\n\n# Print the data dimensions\nprint(\'Shape X_train:\', X_train.shape)\nprint(\'Shape y_train:\', y_train.shape)\nprint(\'Shape X_test:\', X_test.shape)\nprint(\'Shape y_test:\', y_test.shape)\nShape X_train: (75, 1)\nShape y_train: (75,)\nShape X_test: (25, 1)\nShape y_test: (25,)\n\nFit a Regression tree\nYou can use DecisionTreeRegressor() to fit a decision tree regressor in Scikit-learn. Let\'s create an instance of this class just like the classification tasks and fit it to data. For now, we\'ll set the max depth parameter to 3, as we now know that increasing this could lead to overfitting. We can experiment with different depths later.\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nregressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=42, max_depth=3)\nregressor.fit(X_train, y_train)\nDecisionTreeRegressor(criterion=\'mse\', max_depth=3, max_features=None,\n                      max_leaf_nodes=None, min_impurity_decrease=0.0,\n                      min_impurity_split=None, min_samples_leaf=1,\n                      min_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0,\n                      presort=False, random_state=42, splitter=\'best\')\n\nPrediction and evaluation\nThe output of the cell above shows us the default values for most hyperparameters. You are encouraged to check the official documentation for this class for details on options available to you for growing regression trees!\nWe can now predict labels with previously unseen data and calculate MSE. As an extra measure, we can also look at calculating the R-squared value to inspect the goodness of fit for our model.\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as mse\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\n\n# Make predictions and evaluate \ny_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)\nprint(\'MSE score:\', mse(y_test, y_pred))\nprint(\'R-sq score:\', r2_score(y_test,y_pred))\nMSE score: 7.651234359344747\nR-sq score: 0.9134119360857194\n\nVisualize the model fit\nOur R-squared score tells us that this appears to be a very good fit (remember $r^2$ ranges from 0 (poor) to 1 (best)). Let\'s visualize the learned function below with our scatter plot from earlier and see how well it fits.\nX_grid = np.arange(min(X), max(X), 0.01)\nX_grid = X_grid.reshape((len(X_grid), 1))\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,6))\nplt.scatter(X, y, color = \'red\', label=\'data\')\nplt.plot(X_grid, regressor.predict(X_grid), color = \'green\', label=\'Regression function\')\nplt.title(\'Decision Tree Regression\')\nplt.xlabel(\'Features\')\nplt.ylabel(\'Target\')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nWe found this regression line without using any complex non-linear functions, in a fraction of time. This is the key benefit of regression trees over other regression techniques that we have seen earlier.\nSome observations\n\nThe function is not continuous\nHorizontal lines are averages of all data points in sections created\nThese horizontal lines represent sections. Predictions are averages of data points in these sections. So prediction for all values from the same section will be the same\n\nTry changing the max_depth parameter in the model and grow the tree again. The resulting visualization will clearly show you the impact of tree depth on overfitting.\nCaveats\nWithout regularization, decision trees are likely to overfit the training examples.

In the world full of data, Machine Learning has become a to-go field for the ones looking to start off their career. This project shows basic operations performed on the dataset which is widely known as pre-processing. Once the data is ready, 4 main classifier algorithms are applied to find out the Jaccard similarity, F1-score and Accuracy which are the few important parameters one should look at while analysing a model.\nK-Nearest Neighbours:\nKNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. To evaluate any technique we generally look at 3 important aspects:\n\nEase to interpret output\nCalculation time\nPredictive Power\n\n\nPros and Cons associated with KNN\nPros:\n1. No assumptions about data\u200a—\u200auseful, for example, for nonlinear data\n2. Simple algorithm\u200a—\u200ato explain and understand/interpret\n3. High accuracy (relatively)\u200a—\u200ait is pretty high but not competitive in comparison to better supervised learning models\nVersatile\u200a—\u200auseful for classification or regression\n\nCons:\n1. Computationally expensive\u200a—\u200abecause the algorithm stores all of the training data\n2. High memory requirement\n3. Stores all (or almost all) of the training data\n4. Prediction stage might be slow (with big N)\n5. Sensitive to irrelevant features and the scale of the data\n\nSupport Vector Machine:\nSVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for classification or regression problems. It uses a technique called the kernel trick to transform your data and then based on these transformations it finds an optimal boundary between the possible outputs.\n\nPros and Cons associated with SVM\nPros:\n    1. It works really well with a clear margin of separation\n    2. It is effective in high dimensional spaces.\n    3. It is effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n    4. It uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n\nCons:\n    1. It doesn’t perform well when we have large data set because the required training time is higher\n    2. It also doesn’t perform very well, when the data set has more noise i.e. target classes are overlapping\n    3. SVM doesn’t directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation. It is included in the related SVC method of Python scikit-learn library.\n\nLogistic Regression:\nLogistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression).\n\nPros and Cons associated with LR\nPros:\n1. Logistic Regression performs well when the dataset is linearly separable.\n2. Logistic regression is less prone to over-fitting but it can overfit in high dimensional datasets. You should consider Regularization (L1 and L2) techniques to avoid over-fitting in these scenarios.\n3. Logistic Regression not only gives a measure of how relevant a predictor (coefficient size) is, but also its direction of association (positive or negative).\n4. Logistic regression is easier to implement, interpret and very efficient to train. \n\nCons:\n1. Main limitation of Logistic Regression is the assumption of linearity between the dependent variable and the independent variables. In the real world, the data is rarely linearly separable. Most of the time data would be a jumbled mess.\n2. If the number of observations are lesser than the number of features, Logistic Regression should not be used, otherwise it may lead to overfit.\n3. Logistic Regression can only be used to predict discrete functions. Therefore, the dependent variable of Logistic Regression is restricted to the discrete number set. This restriction itself is problematic, as it is prohibitive to the prediction of continuous data.\n\nDecision Trees:\nDecision Tree Classifier is a simple and widely used classification technique. It applies a straitforward idea to solve the classification problem. Decision Tree Classifier poses a series of carefully crafted questions about the attributes of the test record. Each time time it receive an answer, a follow-up question is asked until a conclusion about the calss label of the record is reached.\n\nPros and Cons associated with DT\nPros:\n1. Compared to other algorithms decision trees requires less effort for data preparation during pre-processing.\n2. A decision tree does not require normalization of data.\n3. A decision tree does not require scaling of data as well.\n4. Missing values in the data also does NOT affect the process of building decision tree to any considerable extent.\n5. A Decision trees model is very intuitive and easy to explain to technical teams as well as stakeholders.\n\nCons:\n1. A small change in the data can cause a large change in the structure of the decision tree causing instability.\n2. For a Decision tree sometimes calculation can go far more complex compared to other algorithms.\n3. Decision tree often involves higher time to train the model.\n4. Decision tree training is relatively expensive as complexity and time taken is more.\n5. Decision Tree algorithm is inadequate for applying regression and predicting continuous values.\n\nThank you!\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Saadia-Hassan', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Apr 16, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Nov 7, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 15, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 22, 2021']}","{'location': 'Cracow', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '21 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Divorce-Prediction\nDivorce prediction using logistic regression, kNN and artificial neural network performed on data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Divorce+Predictors+data+set.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/aleksandra197', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Apr 16, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Nov 7, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 11, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 15, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jan 22, 2021']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '148 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Hurricane Trajectories\nYear-wise Hurricane Type prediction\nHurricanes  follow  a  generalized  life  cycle  based  on  wind  speed(wind-speed  minimum  119km/h).The ”Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale” is a 1 to 5 rating based on a hurricane’ssustained wind speed.

Therefore here the main goal is to predict the number of the hurricanesof the particular category that are expected to take place in given inputted year.This can beutilized to make skillful forecasts so with that precautions can be taken to protect from the damage.\nDimenasionality reduction on hurricane trejectory prediction\nPrincipal  Component  Analysis  (PCA)  is  an  unsupervised,  non-parametric  statisticaltechnique primarily used for dimentionality reduction in machine learning.High dimen-tionality means that the dataset has a large number of features.  The primary problemassociated with high-dimensionality in the machine learning field is computation com-plexity.  Also dimentionality reduction helps in proper data visualisation.  In our caseprediction is the time sensitive.  As quick as possible knowing the trajectories of the hur-ricane can save many precious lives.  So for getting the quick response of the hurricane we used PCA.\nReference\n\n\nB. I.

A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.\nAn education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.\nThe company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%.\nNow, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.\nAs you can see, there are a lot of leads generated in the initial stage (top) but only a few of them come out as paying customers from the bottom. In the middle stage, you need to nurture the potential leads well (i.e. educating the leads about the product, constantly communicating etc. ) in order to get a higher lead conversion.\nX Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.

Analyse customer-level data which has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group.\nThe dataset is taken from the Kaggle website and it has a total of 2,84,807 transactions, out of which 492 are fraudulent.\nBusiness Problem Overview\nFor many banks, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. Banking fraud, however, poses a significant threat to this goal for different banks. In terms of substantial financial losses, trust and credibility, this is a concerning issue to both banks and customers alike.\nIt has been estimated by Nilson report that by 2020 the banking frauds would account to $30 billion worldwide. With the rise in digital payment channels, the number of fraudulent transactions is also increasing with new and different ways.\nIn the banking industry, credit card fraud detection using machine learning is not just a trend but a necessity for them to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning is helping these institutions to reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees, and denials of legitimate transactions.\nUnderstanding and Defining Fraud\nCredit card fraud is any dishonest act and behaviour to obtain information without the proper authorization from the account holder for financial gain. Among different ways of frauds, Skimming is the most common one, which is the way of duplicating of information located on the magnetic strip of the card.  Apart from this, the other ways are:\nManipulation/alteration of genuine cards\nCreation of counterfeit cards\nStolen/lost credit cards\nFraudulent telemarketing\nData Dictionary\nThe data set includes credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a period of two days in September 2013. Out of a total of 2,84,807 transactions, 492 were fraudulent. This data set is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of the total transactions. The data set has also been modified with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to maintain confidentiality. Apart from ‘time’ and ‘amount’, all the other features (V1, V2, V3, up to V28) are the principal components obtained using PCA. The feature 'time' contains the seconds elapsed between the first transaction in the data set and the subsequent transactions. The feature 'amount' is the transaction amount. The feature 'class' represents class labelling, and it takes the value 1 in cases of fraud and 0 in others.\nProject Pipeline\nThe project pipeline can be briefly summarized in the following four steps:\nData Understanding: Here, you need to load the data and understand the features present in it. This would help you choose the features that you will need for your final model.\nExploratory data analytics (EDA): Normally, in this step, you need to perform univariate and bivariate analyses of the data, followed by feature transformations, if necessary. For the current data set, because Gaussian variables are used, you do not need to perform Z-scaling. However, you can check if there is any skewness in the data and try to mitigate it, as it might cause problems during the model-building phase.\nTrain/Test Split: Now you are familiar with the train/test split, which you can perform in order to check the performance of your models with unseen data. Here, for validation, you can use the k-fold cross-validation method. You need to choose an appropriate k value so that the minority class is correctly represented in the test folds.\nModel-Building/Hyperparameter Tuning: This is the final step at which you can try different models and fine-tune their hyperparameters until you get the desired level of performance on the given dataset. You should try and see if you get a better model by the various sampling techniques.\nModel Evaluation: Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Note that since the data is imbalanced it is is more important to identify which are fraudulent transactions accurately than the non-fraudulent.

After uploading the dataframe and minor cleaning, I checked out two multiple line graphs: one with the raw data and one that was based on each year's percent change from base year 2000. From there I moved to modeling.\nModeling\nI first created X and y variables, with X equal to median household income, population, and housing units; y was equal to median home value.  Next I created X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test, and performed a train_test_split. I ran two different models: linear regression and random forest. I scaled the data before running the models as each variable had significantly different scales.  Then I ran a simple linear regression model and checked some scatter plots for the model predicted values vs actual values.  I also did this for each individual variable just to see what they looked like.  Next I ran the random forest model through a gridsearch, which determined the best estimator was n_estimators = 60.\nResults\nI initially had my test size set to .2, which resulted in train/test scores of .9 for my linear regression. My random forest model got train/test scores of .96 and .56, respectively.  This seemed weird, and I realized because I have such a small dataset (19 rows), my X_test was only a sample size of 3 or 4.  This is not sufficient.  So I changed my test size to .33, which is still only about 6, but it's a little better.  My linear regression model returned scores of .95 and .83, and random forest scores were .98 and .7.  This is still a bit odd, but more in line what would be considered realistic.\nConclusion\nI don’t feel terrible about a model predicting .83 accuracy, but not super great either. I think the reality is that going further back in time with the data would be very helpful; 19 rows is very limiting. I only have 6 points of data in my test set, which is better than nothing but it’s not a lot to test on. Unfortunately, collecting data was probably my most time-consuming part of this project and obtaining more was not possible with the time constraints.\nThe project wasn’t a bust, though. In coordination with population growth generally, the trend did show that increasing incomes coordinated more with home values. I recommended that the county continue to increase housing supply to get ahead of the demand and help reduce home values. I also recommended more research to include rental rates, and a comparison of proportion of housing units for ownership vs for rental throughout the county.\nData Dictionary\n\n\n\nFeature\nType\nDataset\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nindex\nint\ndf\nnumbered index of the rows\n\n\nyear\nint\ndf\nyear the data is from\n\n\nhousing_units\nint\ndf\nnumber of housing units available to live in (single fam. houses, apartments, condos, etc)\n\n\nmed_home_val\nint\ndf\nmedian home value\n\n\npopulation\nint\ndf\npopulation\n\n\nmed_income\nint\ndf\nmedian household income\n\n\n\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/stephenschott', 'info_list': ['1', 'Python', 'Updated Feb 3, 2021', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Python', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jul 14, 2020']}","{'location': 'Seattle, WA', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '14 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Ames, Iowa Correlations in Housing Data\n\nProblem Statement\nWhat can a homeowner or house flipper can do to maximize a house value prior to selling?\nData Gathering\nThis project was based on datasets available on kaggle.com.\nMethods\nThe data is fairly complete but definitely had some issues. I found that 21 of the 80 columns contained null values. I intended to use up to seven variables in my model to show correlation, so I looked at the top ten or so variables to see if there were any issues that jumped out at me. There weren’t significant issues with the top ten or so variables except that many rows in “garage area” contained nulls. I deleted those as they amounted to approximately 5% of the data, which is not insignificant but in order to accurately create my models based on current information, I needed to be able to utilize this column. I also saw no way to be able to make any kind of educated guess to fill any of these nulls in, and time didn’t allow for that kind of research anyway. I also created a column that subtracted the year the house was built from the year the data was collected in order to get the house age. The seven variables I used were: overall quality, ground floor living area, garage area, garage cars, total basement square footage, first floor square footage, and house age.\nModeling\nFor model 0, I set my features to be overall quality, ground floor living area, and garage area. I set my X and y variables, and then created X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test for train_test_split. Next I instantiated my linear regression model, and fit it with my training data. I essentially repeated this process six times. For models 1 through 3, I scaled data first, and then used the top three, five, and seven variables in linear regression models. For models 4 through 6, I used scaled data and used the top three, five, and seven variables in Ridge and Lasso models. Being my first project, I didn’t realize I actually created two models each for models 4, 5, and 6, one Ridge and one Lasso. They all got roughly the same scores so it is a moot point, but it was an early lesson for me.\nResults\nModel 0: train: .75 test: .77 \nModel 1: train: .74 test: .8\nModel 2: train: .76 test: .82\nModel 3: train: .76 test: .82\nModel 4: train: .75 test: .78\nModel 5: train: .76 test: .82\nModel 6: train: .77 test: .83\nConclusion\nThis was a big learning experience for me, being my first project.  All of my results had slight bias, meaning I could have added more variables for a better model. The results were  not terrible though.  I concluded that the best way to increase your home value on average is to improve the overall quality of the house (i.e. kitchen, house fixtures, etc), and open up the ground living area if possible. Having a garage and/or basement also correlated well to higher values, but those are either impossible or too expensive to install, so any increased value for the seller would be offset by the cost to build.\nThis was an interesting project for me as I went in thinking kitchens and bathrooms would be the biggest value gain for homeowners, but those were down the list. There wasn’t a category for kitchen or bathroom quality, which may have made a difference. Regardless, it was an important lesson that as a data scientist you have to go in open minded on every project, while at the same time you must use your knowledge of a field to identify things that may not make sense or could be errors, either on our part or the dataset. Overall, I liked this project and would love working in the real-estate industry to find more information like this.\nData Dictionary\n\n\n\nFeature\nType\nDataset\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nId\nint\ntrain\nhouse sale id\n\n\npid\nint\ntrain\nparcel identification number  -

What correlations on Reddit can we use to identify causes and solutions?\nData Gathering\nI gathered all of my data from two reddit groups. There are GayMen (https://www.reddit.com/r/GayMen/) and actuallesbians (https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/). I obtained all my data with the Pushshift API, which involved two batches of 500 for each reddit group.\nMethods\nCleaning was fairly minimal to maintain as many words as possible. I converted the data from json to dataframes, and combined the dataframes.  I changed the subreddit column so that GayMen = 1 and actuallesbian = 0. I combined the selftext (the text in the post) and title (text in the title of the post) columns into a new column called text. This allowed me to have one X to compare with my one y variable. I used sklearn's stopwords and removed roughly 15 of their words that could be important in this study, primarily pronouns.\nModeling\nI set X equal to the text column, and y to the subreddit column. I set up X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test and made my test size .33, stratified y, and created a random state of 42. For model 1, I created a ‘pipe’ with cvec and lr, for CountVectorizer() and LogisticRegression() respectively. The ‘pipe parameters’ included my stopwords, max_features of 500, 750, and 1000, min_df of 3, 5, and 9, and ngram_range of (1,1) and (1,2). And lastly, I created a GridSearchCV, which included the pipe, pipe parameters, and cv of 5. I repeated this process for my second model, the only difference being that my pipe used TfidfVectorizer(tvec) instead of cvec. My third model ran through the same pipe, with the exception of utilizing MultinomialNB (naive bayes) instead of logistic regression.\nResults\nModel 1: I fit my X_train and y_train to my gridsearch and found the best estimator to be max_features=750, min_df=9, ngram_range=(1, 1). My train and test accuracy scores were .95 and .82, respectively.\nModel 2: max_features = 1000, min_df = 3, and ngram_range = (1,1). The train and test scores came back .9 each\nModel 3: best estimator was max_features = 1000, min_df= 3, and ngram_range = (1,1). The train score was .89 while the test score came back .81\nConclusion\nWe can find significant differences in gay/lesbian subreddit text, but this study did not compare the exact words that were different between the two subreddits. Ultimately, comparing gay and lesbian Reddit language is perhaps useful for differentiating gay men from lesbians, but not the best way to diagnose problems within the lesbian community. A better method would be to conduct surveys with lesbians in marriages that have ended and lesbians in marriages that have lasted over x years and find trends.\nData Dictionary\n\n\n\nFeature\nType\nDataset\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsubreddit\nint\ndf\n1 = GayMen subreddit, 0 = actuallesbians subreddit\n\n\nselftext\nobj\ndf\nbody text of the reddit submission\n\n\ntitle\nobj\ndf\ntitle text of the reddit submission\n\n\ntext\nobj\ndf\ncombined body and title text of the reddit submission\n\n\n\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/stephenschott', 'info_list': ['R', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 15, 2020', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', '2', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Sep 19, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Apr 21, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020']}","{'location': 'Dallas ,TX', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '15 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/SindhujaJayakumar', 'info_list': ['R', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 15, 2020', 'Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 10, 2020', '2', 'MIT license', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Sep 19, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated Apr 21, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 9, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 7, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '69 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Coursera-The_Best_Classifier_Project\nk-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression classification algorithms on the given data.

And here I used three classifiers primiraly,based on the dataset that are decisiontree,support vector machine and logistic regression.The accuracy rate for each of the classifier is calculated individually.

The motion of the wheelchair is controlled via the subject’s eye movement using IR sensors. The eye tracking-based technology employs the use of Infrared (IR) sensor modules, that are mounted on an eye frame to trace the movement of the iris. Since, IR sensors detect only white objects a unique sequence of digital bits is generated corresponding to each eye movement. These signals are then processed via a micro controller to control the motors of the wheelchair. The potential and efficiency of previously developed rehabilitation systems that use head motion, chin control, sip-n-puff control, voice recognition, and EEG signals variedly have also been explored in detail. They were found to be inconvenient as they served either limited usability or non-affordability. After multiple regression analyses, the proposed design was developed as a cost-effective, flexible and stream-lined alternative for people who have trouble adopting conventional assistive technologies.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Ananya-B', 'info_list': ['Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '12 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Virusc\nRequirements - python interpreter (3.6 & above) ,\nInstall Python Packages - numpy , pandas , flask , newspaper3k , sklearn , flask_mysqldb , matplotlib .\nfollow this steps before running the code:-\n\nInstall xampp\nDownload Apache and Mysql in Xampp\nLaunch the control panel and start Apache and Mysql\nClick on admin corresponding to Mysql\nGo to SQL and paste corona sql text file and run it ,\nNow we are ready to run the main.py file\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/SuyogAhuja', 'info_list': ['Updated Apr 6, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Apr 12, 2020']}",,,,,,,,
