Thanks to the clearly arranged interface, the user always has an overview of his diabetes. The app also provides information on several thousand foods including carbohydrates and other nutrients.\n\nQuickly and easily track your blood glucose, insulin, carbohydrates, HbA1c, activity, weight, pulse, blood pressure and oxygen saturation\nCustomizable units\nVisualize your blood glucose level in a graph\nDetailed logs of your data\nSettings for basal rate, correction factor and meal-bolus-factor\nFood database with thousands of entries\nPDF and CSV export\nBackup\nReminder\nEstimated HbA1c\nStatistics\nDark Mode\nLocalized in English, German, French, Spanish and Italian\n\n      \nDistribution\n\nAbout\nHistory\nDevelopment of Diaguard started in October 2013. It was as one of several small projects of one developer who was trying to gain traction on the Android platform. This project soon evolved into a vision named Diaguard which saw its initial release in July 2014. Since then it has received many updates, much appreciated feedback from its users and a little bit of marketing with the help of direct contact and mouth to mouth propaganda. But at the end of the day every line of code has been provided by one sole developer in his spare-time. This should change in April 2020 when the decision was made to go open source.\nGoals\nDiaguard should help diabetics with monitoring their diabetes. It should be able to replace the handwritten diary completely and to supplement tasks like basal rate tests or carb counting. It should help diabetologists with monitoring their patients regularly and when preparing a health insurance application.\nDiaguard's users should always be and feel in full control. All user-generated data must stay on the same device until the user explicitely decides to transfer something to another device, e.g. during an export or backup. Nothing is shared with remote services and network is only used to read data from a food database.User data must not be lost. Therefor database migrations enable user data to be carried from version 1.0 to any existing and upcoming release.\nDiaguard should be accessible to most people. Therefor its design is heavily influenced by the Material Design Guidelines and tested with accessibility tools like TalkBack and Accessibility Scanner.\nDiaguard should only be used under the supervision of a diabetologist.\nDiaguard should not be used by minors without the supervision of a parent or legal guardian.\nDiaguard is not a medical app and serves no therapeutical purpose.\nBusiness model\nThere is none.\nDiaguard exists for three reasons: for learning, for fun and for saying thank you. This app kickstarted the career of a professional software developer by leading through the whole software lifecycle: creating a concept, building software from scratch, publishing it to the masses and maintaining a legacy project with additions sprinkled here and there. Additionally it was and is pure fun to enhance this app and to see feedback from a helpful and thankful community. Last but not least Diaguard is a way of giving something back.\nFor these reasons, Diaguard has been, is and will always be free of cost.\nIf you want to buy me a beer or support me in general, please use the donate button and be aware of my thanks.\n\n\n\nDevelopment\nLanguages\nEnglish is used as general language for naming things. Everything except the localization should be written in English.\nJava is used as programming language. Currently there are no plans to migrate to Kotlin to prevent a multi-language project. A possible approach could be splitting up the monolith into multiple modules which unleashes the potential to switch language while staying consistent within a module.\nSQLite is used as query language for the database. Object-relational mapping takes then place via ORMLite.\nXML is used as markup language for user interfaces. These views are then bound to Java via Butter Knife.\nLocalization\nLocalization takes place locally and affects following components:\n\nUser interfaces: localized via Android resources (one strings.xml per language)\nCommon food: localized via custom file import (one food_common.csv for all languages)\nDefault tags: localized via custom file import (one tags.csv for all languages)\n\nCurrently the localization process requires certain programming skills. This should and could be improved by using an external service in order to support localizations by non-developers.\nArchitecture\nThere are two architectural design patterns that are being used for Diaguard: Model-View-Controller and Domain-driven design.\nModel-View-Controller (MVC) was a widely spread design pattern in the early days of Android development until Google presented its Architecture Components in 2017 and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) took over. A gradual transition to MVVM is planned due to its advantages over MVC, e.g. regarding encapsulation and testability.\nDomain-driven design improves the structure by grouping files in features. Every feature describes one aspect of the project and should be self-contained to improve focus during development. The only exception to this rule is the shared package which contains everything that is used in multiple features (e.g. database- or networking logic).\nTesting\nTesting takes place via JUnit, Espresso and Robolectric. Tests are few in number and far from perfect, since most of Diaguard has been developed in the early of days of one developer. However the decision to go open source came with a code of conduct, and instrumentation testing major features was the first step in a right direction. The goal now is to unit- and instrumentation test every new and edited feature in order to increase the quality with every commit.\nThird-party licenses\nThis software uses following technologies with great appreciation:\n\nAboutLibraries\nAndroidX\nApache Commons Text\nApp Privacy Policy Generator\nBetterPickers\nButter Knife\nEventBus\nFloatingActionButton\nGson\nJoda-Time\njoda-time-android\nJUnit\nMaterial Components for Android\nMPAndroidChart\nOpencsv\nOpen Food Facts\nORMLite\nORMLite Android\nParallax Everywhere\nPDFjet\nPicasso\nRetrofit\nRobolectric\nSchweizer Nährwertdatenbank\n\nThese dependencies are bundled with Diaguard but under the terms of their respective license.\nLegal\nThe manufacturer of this software assumes no responsibility for the topicality, correctness, completeness or quality of the information provided.

It uses logistic regression to classify the diabetic outcomes of each person's record.\nThe type-2 diabetes is commonly called diabetes mellitus. It can be defined as a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). We consider the mellitus here. After several researches we found that some parameters are directly responsible for the mellitus to occur. By using the data of the people with diabetes and without diabetes, a dataset will be  built. We further use that dataset to classify the people who are in the risk of getting diabetes.\nIntended Approach:\nLoading the required libraries\nData Loading- The observations of people are stored in a file and that file is loaded in environment.\nCorrelations- The proportionalities of attributes of data that can be identified by correlation coefficient.This helps to know which attributes are highly dependent on prediction variable.Visualizations- To graph the structure of data and its relations, as in how they vary and their relation with other data\nPreparing the data- Dividing data into training data and testing data, by listing out the major factors, i,e direct proportionality.\nBuild models- Classify the concerned person with diabetes or not.\nPrediction- A trained model is used to predict the data and for training data.\nROC Curve- Receiver operating characterstic curve, graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.\nComparison between models- Comparing real values with real data, we can check the performance of our application.\nTech Stack:\nProgramming Language- Python(intermediate)\nLibraries- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn\nMachine Learning- Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes Theorem and Gradient Boosting.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/itspsneha', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 26, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 26, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 25, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 14, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Mar 28, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['1', '          follower'], ['0', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '6 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Diabetes-ML-Predictive-Analysis-Project\nMachine Learning project for predicting diabetes diagnosis in patients presenting with risk factors.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/MQureshi10', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 26, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 26, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 25, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 14, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Mar 28, 2020']}","{'location': 'Kolkata, India', 'stats_list': [['4', '          followers'], ['9', '          following'], ['79']], 'contributions': '212 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['PIMA-Indians-Diabetes-Predicition-Model\nWe will try to build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/arnabbarui5', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 26, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 26, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 25, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 14, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Mar 28, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['1', '          follower'], ['3', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '9 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/swapster22', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 26, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 26, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 25, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 29, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 14, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Mar 28, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['3', '          followers'], ['3', '          following'], ['5']], 'contributions': '37 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Prediction-Of-type-2-Diabetes\nDiabetes is a chronic disease.

The severity of the condition is variable.  Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications or conditions such as autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke and a weak immune system.Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired, such as community- or hospital-acquired or health care-associated pneumonia.  Vaccines to prevent certain types of pneumonia are available. Other methods of prevention include hand washing and not smoking. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the pneumonia is severe, the affected person is generally hospitalized. Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low.  Pneumonia affects approximately 450 million people globally (7% of the population) and results in about 4 million deaths per year. Pneumonia was regarded by Canadian pathologist William Osler in the 19th century as ""the captain of the men of death"". With the introduction of antibiotics and vaccines in the 20th century, survival greatly improved. Nevertheless, in developing countries, and also among the very old, the very young and the chronically ill, pneumonia remains a leading cause of death.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 experience mild to serve respiratory illness. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness and even death.  At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, many ongoing clinical trials are evaluating potential treatments.  Solution: The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently and not touching your face.  This app provides basic alerts for the prevention of Corona virus and the necessary information one needs to know about covid-19.  We take care of the correct information and updates through this app.  The app has the following main sections for citizens:  1. Online information : Uses your phone location to display corona virus stats in your country. Contains hourly updates about No of cases, cases Recovered and no of Deaths in a particular country to make people aware of Corona disaster in their countries and the rest of the world.  2. Set reminders: contain alarm setting for hand wash and mask change.  People ( specifically the elder once who are more prone to covid-19 ) usually forget to wash their hands or to change mask timely.  This option will help them to set alarm according to their needs and to be safe.  3. Protect yourself : image explanation of how to wash hands , dispose mask and other preventative measures  which helps to reduce rapid spread of novel corona virus.  4. FAQs: Contain general questions that one must know about covid-19.  5. Myths: contain myths about covid-19 prevention   People spread wrong preventive measures about this disease which is not technologically beneficial to fight the Corona virus. Thus, this section contains some of the misinformation spreading across the world which need not follow.   Few features like corona update and vaccine R&D will be uploaded on the app soon.  Advisories and instructions will be updated from time to time via PUSH notification on the App.  This App will provide quick information and help to you.
