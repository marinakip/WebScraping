""This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage."" and used a simple random forest classifier.\n\nMotivation\nThe motivation was to experiment  with end to end machine learning project and get some idea about deployment platform like Heroku and offcourse this ""\nDiabetes is an increasingly growing health issue due to our inactive lifestyle. If it is detected in time then through proper medical treatment, adverse effects can be prevented. To help in early detection, technology can be used very reliably and efficiently. Using machine learning we have built a predictive model that can predict whether the patient is diabetes positive or not."".\nThis is also sort of fun to work on a project like this which could be beneficial for the society.\nDemo\nVisit this link for live demo\nLearning Objective\nThe following points were the objective of the project . If you are looking for all the following points in this repo then i have not covered all in this repo. I\'m working on blog about this mini project and I\'ll update the link of blog about all the points in details later . (The main intention was to create an end-to-end ML project.)\n\nData gathering\nDescriptive Analysis\nData Visualizations\nData Preprocessing\nData Modelling\nModel Evaluation\nModel Deployment\n\nTechnical Aspect\n\nTraining a machine learning model using scikit-learn.\nBuilding and hosting a Flask web app on Heroku.\nA user has to put details like Number of Pregnancies, Insulin Level, Age, BMI etc .\nOnce it get all the fields information , the prediction is displayed on a new page .\n\nTechnologies Used\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBug / Feature Request\nIf you find a bug (the website couldn\'t handle the query and / or gave undesired results), kindly open an issue here by including your search query and the expected result.\nIf you\'d like to request a new function, feel free to do so by opening an issue here. Please include sample queries and their corresponding results.\nInstallation\n\nClone this repository and unzip it.\nAfter downloading, cd into the flask directory.\nBegin a new virtual environment with Python 3 and activate it.\nInstall the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt\nExecute the command: python app.py\n\nTeam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDitikrushan Giri\n\n\n\nCredits\n\nTook

There was a total of\n50 columns ranging from gender and race, to number of procedures and hospital visits, to various medication\nprescriptions.\nJupyter Notebook was used to run Python code. Data was first explored and analyzed to check for\ntrends and data visualizations (ie. matplotlib, plotly, sns) then preprocessed for clean-up and some tweaking and\nengineering to have it ready for machine learning.\nOverall, the dataset was relatively balanced across several features. The graphs below show a count plot of gender,\npatients prescribed with insulin, and whether patients were readmitted or not.\n\n\n\nMost readmitted patients were 50-90 years old.\nEven within different age groups, there was a balanced distribution of patients that were readmitted and not readmitted.\n\nFeature Engineering\nTwo columns were created to improve the model.\nThe first new column was created to label the patient as Type1 or Type2 diabetic based on the medications they were prescribed.\nThe dataset contains 3 diagnoses columns\n(primary, secondary and tertiary) indicating disease type.\nThis information was used for the second new column which labels whether the disease is related to diabetes.\nModeling\nData was split then trained by several algorithms. XGBoost gave\nthe best score and all the best parameters were found using Gridsearch. The top 15 features\n(out of 135 total predictive features) were extracted using SelectFromModel while maintaining the top ROC_AUC score.\nTop Features:\n\nf2 - Number of Lab Procedures\nf4 - Number of Medications\nf1 - Time in Hospital (Length of Stay)\nf0 - Age\nf3 - Number of (non-lab) Procedures\nf8 - Number of Diagnoses\nf7 - Number of Inpatient Visits\nf5 - Number of Outpatient Visits\nf6 - Number of Emergency Visits\nf24 - Female\nf59 - Secondary Diagnosis being Circulatory\n23 - Change in Medications\nf21 - Insulin\nf9 - Metformin\nf99 - Diagnosis/Disease is not Diabetes Related\n\n\nResults\nTo test the model, a random sample (shown below) from the holdout set was used\nto predict the probability of readmission status.\n\nThe model was given the above sample information without the last line which shows the true readmission answer and produced\nthe following result.\n\nThe readmission status was predicted correctly for this sample with\n33.74% chance of being readmitted and 66.26% chance of not being readmitted.\nPre-trained data was deployed using Flask to make a diabetes readmission classifier web application to make predictions\non user-submitted feature values.\nGetting Started\n1.

It is not only a disease but also creator of different kinds of diseases like heart attack, blindness etc. The normal identifying process is that patients need to visit a diagnostic center, consult their doctor, and sit tight for a day or more to get their reports. So, the objective of this project is to identify whether the patient has diabetes or not based on diagnostic measurements. Dataset Used: The dataset used has been obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository having 769 records of Female Patients exclusively.\nDataset Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes\n1-Pregnancies: No. of times pregnant\n2-Glucose: Plasma Glucose Concentration a 2 hour in an oral glucose tolerance test (mg/dl) A 2-hour value between 140 and 200 mg/dL (7.8 and 11.1 mmol/L) is called impaired glucose tolerance. This is called ""pre- diabetes."" It means you are at increased risk of developing diabetes over time. A glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher is used to diagnose diabetes.\n3-Blood Pressure: Diastolic Blood Pressure(mmHg): If Diastolic B.P > 90 means High B.P (High Probability of Diabetes) Diastolic B.P < 60 means low B.P (Less Probability of Diabetes)\n4-Skin Thickness: Triceps Skin Fold Thickness (mm) – A value used to estimate body fat. Normal Triceps SkinFold Thickness in women is 23mm. Higher thickness leads to obesity and chances of diabetes increases.\n5-Insulin: 2-Hour Serum Insulin (mu U/ml) Normal Insulin Level 16-166 mIU/L Values above this range can be alarming.\n6-BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/ height in m2) Body Mass Index of 18.5 to 25 is within the normal range BMI between 25 and 30 then it falls within the overweight range. A BMI of 30 or over falls within the obese range.\n7-Diabetes Pedigree Function: It provides information about diabetes history in relatives and genetic relationship of those relatives with patients. Higher Pedigree Function means patient is more likely to have diabetes.\n8-Age (years)\n9-Outcome: Class Variable (0 or 1) where ‘0’ denotes patient is not having diabetes and ‘1’ denotes patient having diabetes The dependent variable is whether the patient is having diabetes or not.\n\nSoftware Package Used: Python-Scikit Learn, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib.\nAdvantage of this project: The rules derived will be helpful for doctors to identify patients suffering from diabetes. Further predicting the disease early leads to treating the patient before it becomes critical.\nThe notebooks contains all steps of ML problem : classification unsing supervised methods, that can helps beginners to understand quickly all stages of Machine Learning.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/anassNasserallah', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 2, 2020', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020', '1', 'Python', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 30, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jun 5, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 3, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated May 3, 2020']}"

Let me explain each part and show you guys how to use them in sequence to understand the workflow.\nUnivariate Statistical Analysis\nThis type of data consists of only one variable. The analysis of univariate data is thus the simplest form of analysis since the information deals with only one quantity that changes. It does not deal with causes or relationships and the main purpose of the analysis is to describe the data and find patterns that exist within it. The example of a univariate data can be height.\n\nSuppose that the heights of seven students of a class is recorded(figure 1),there is only one variable that is height and it is not dealing with any cause or relationship. The description of patterns found in this type of data can be made by drawing conclusions using central tendency measures (mean, median and mode), dispersion or spread of data (range, minimum, maximum, quartiles, variance and standard deviation) and by using frequency distribution tables, histograms, pie charts, frequency polygon and bar charts.\nMultivariate Statistical Analysis\nMultivariate statistics is a subdivision of statistics encompassing the simultaneous observation and analysis of more than one outcome variable. The application of multivariate statistics is multivariate analysis.\nMultivariate statistics concerns understanding the different aims and background of each of the different forms of multivariate analysis, and how they relate to each other. The practical application of multivariate statistics to a particular problem may involve several types of univariate and multivariate analyses in order to understand the relationships between variables and their relevance to the problem being studied.\nIn addition, multivariate statistics is concerned with multivariate probability distributions, in terms of both\nhow these can be used to represent the distributions of observed data;\nhow they can be used as part of statistical inference, particularly where several different quantities are of interest to the same analysis.\nCertain types of problems involving multivariate data, for example simple linear regression and multiple regression, are not usually considered to be special cases of multivariate statistics because the analysis is dealt with by considering the (univariate) conditional distribution of a single outcome variable given the other variables.\nInferential Statistical Analysis\nStatistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying distribution of probability.[1] Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population.\nInferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population. In machine learning, the term inference is sometimes used instead to mean ""make a prediction, by evaluating an already trained model"";[2] in this context deducing properties of the model is referred to as training or learning (rather than inference), and using a model for prediction is referred to as inference (instead of prediction)\nPredective Statistical Analysis\nPredictive analytics encompasses a variety of statistical techniques from data mining, predictive modelling, and machine learning, that analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about future or otherwise unknown events.\nIn business, predictive models exploit patterns found in historical and transactional data to identify risks and opportunities. Models capture relationships among many factors to allow assessment of risk or potential associated with a particular set of conditions, guiding decision-making for candidate transactions\nThe defining functional effect of these technical approaches is that predictive analytics provides a predictive score (probability) for each individual (customer, employee, healthcare patient, product SKU, vehicle, component, machine, or other organizational unit) in order to determine, inform, or influence organizational processes that pertain across large numbers of individuals, such as in marketing, credit risk assessment, fraud detection, manufacturing, healthcare, and government operations including law enforcement.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/ravichaubey', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 4, 2020', 'Updated May 24, 2020', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 10, 2020', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Updated Apr 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 2, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020']}","{'location': 'Maharashtra Nagpur, India', 'stats_list': [['2', '          followers'], ['6', '          following'], ['13']], 'contributions': '67 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Ashlo', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 4, 2020', 'Updated May 24, 2020', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 10, 2020', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Updated Apr 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 2, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020']}","{'location': 'İstanbul ', 'stats_list': [['42', '          followers'], ['29', '          following'], ['2']], 'contributions': '334 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/mrwttldl', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 4, 2020', 'Updated May 24, 2020', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 10, 2020', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Updated Apr 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 2, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020']}","{'location': 'Yangon', 'stats_list': [['0', '          followers'], ['8', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '33 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Classification-and-Diagnosis-of-Diabetes\nData Science and Machine Learning is helping medical professionals make diagnosis easier by bridging the gap between huge data sets and human knowledge.

Drilling down further, helped me understand that patients with diabetes have high Glucose in their body irrespective of the Age.\nThe results of Machine Learning algorithms can be seen below:\n\n\n\nModel Type\nFalse Prediction\nF-1 Score\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression\n36\n0.78\n0.86\n\n\nRandom Forest Classifier with default parameters\n37\n0.73\n0.85\n\n\nRandom Forest Classifier with some tweeking\n31\n0.75\n0.88\n\n\nRandom Forest Classifier with best parameters\n36\n0.73\n0.86\n\n\nSupport Vector Classifier with default parameters\n87\n0.52\n0.66\n\n\nSupport Vector Classifier with best parameters\n39\n0.76\n0.85\n\n\n\nFrom the above table, it is very much clear that Logistic Regression or Random Forest Classifier with some tweeking will work the best for this data as it has high accuracy along with high F-1 Score. While, the Support Vector Classifier with default parameters performs the worst!\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/skulkarni218', 'info_list': ['HTML', 'Updated May 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 3, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Swift', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['4', '          followers'], ['4', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '87 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/sidupadhyayula', 'info_list': ['HTML', 'Updated May 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 3, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Swift', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020']}","{'location': 'Chennai, India', 'stats_list': [['0', '          followers'], ['6', '          following'], ['11']], 'contributions': '81 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['LDA_with_SMOTE_PIMA_INDIANS_Diabetes_Data\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/SheikMohamed1987', 'info_list': ['HTML', 'Updated May 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 3, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Swift', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020']}","{'location': 'Trivandrum,Kerala', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '97 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['train-test-split\ntrain test split defined\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/lekmeera', 'info_list': ['HTML', 'Updated May 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 3, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Swift', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020']}","{'location': 'Dublin', 'stats_list': [['2', '          followers'], ['1', '          following'], ['11']], 'contributions': '60 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/sujaytalesara', 'info_list': ['HTML', 'Updated May 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 3, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Swift', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['4', '          followers'], ['10', '          following'], ['9']], 'contributions': '44 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/dhruval-p', 'info_list': ['HTML', 'Updated May 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 3, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Swift', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020']}","{'location': 'Germnay', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '27 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Prediction-of-Diabetes-Induced-Complications-using-Different-Machine-Learning-Algorithms\nContributors\n\nTahsinur Rahman\nAniqa Zaida Khanom\nSheikh Mastura Farzana\n\nThis thesis project was done as part of the Computer Science and Engineering curriculum of BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. It presents a comparative analysis of different Machine Learning algorithms in predicting health complications that are induced by Diabetes Mellitus. The thesis was conducted in a group of three students under the guidance of a supervising faculty member and a co-supervisor.\nThe research paper written on the topic was titled ""Analysis of Linear and Non-Linear Classifiers in Imbalanced Data to Predict Diabetes Induced Complications"". It was presented at The 15th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining MLDM 2019, held in New York, USA. The manuscript of the paper is available in the \'MLDM Conference Paper\' folder. The manuscript of the thesis report and relevant codes are available in this repository.\nDiabetes Mellitus is a medical condition of the Pancreas in which the body‘s ability to produce or respond to the hormone, Insulin, diminishes. As a result, over time it damages other organs in the body- primarily Kidney, Liver, Eyes, Heart and Brain. This proposed model uses time\nseries data of a year that contains 164 features including results of different pathological tests. Various machine learning algorithms are used to predict the probability of Diabetes induced\nNephropathy and Cardiovascular disease.\nFor implementation Python was used as the primary language with few scripts in the R programming language. Python libraries like pandas, numpy,scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc. were also used.\nhttp://dspace.bracu.ac.bd/xmlui/handle/10361/10945\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/SheikhMasturaFarzana', 'info_list': ['HTML', 'Updated May 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 3, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Swift', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020']}","{'location': 'California', 'stats_list': [['8', '          followers'], ['150', '          following'], ['693']], 'contributions': '101 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['\nExperimenting with the Bluetooth BLE devices I bought for the Abbott FreeStyle Libre sensor (mainly the Bubble and MiaoMiao transmitters, M5Stack and the Mi Band and Watlaa watches) and trying something new compared to the traditional apps:\n\na universal SwiftUI application for iPhone, iPad and Mac Catalyst;\nan independent Apple Watch app connecting directly via Bluetooth;\nscanning the Libre directly via NFC;\nusing online servers for calibrating just like Abbott’s algorithm;\nvarying the reading interval (the Bubble firmware allows to set it from 1 to 15 minutes while the MiaoMiao one to reduce it to 1 or 3 minutes);\na detailed log to check the traffic from/to the BLE devices and remote servers.\n\nStill too early to decide the final design (but I really like already the evil logo 😈), here there are the first rough screenshots:\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0/\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\nLibre 2: YEP!  -  Bubble: NOPE :(\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nThe project started as a single script for the iPad Swift Playgrounds and was quickly converted to an app by using a standard Xcode template: it should compile finely without external dependencies just after changing the Bundle Identifier in the General panel and the Team in the Signing and Capabilities tab of Xcode -- Spike users know already very well what that means... ;)\nPlease refer to the TODOs list for the up-to-date status of all the current limitations and known bugs of this prototype.\n\nCredits: bubbledevteam, dabear, LibreMonitor, Loop, Marek Macner, Nightguard, RileyLink iOS, WoofWoof, xDrip for iOS.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/markthomas93', 'info_list': ['HTML', 'Updated May 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 1, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 1, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 3, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 8, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 29, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Apr 27, 2020', 'Swift', 'Updated Apr 28, 2020']}"
