At least 50 of the 640 districts studied have a high prevalence of diabetes — greater than one in every 10 among women.\nAnd hence, FeCare classifier model aims to detect diabetes in Indian women. The clasifier was trained using Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset\nDataset info:\nThe dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include:\n\nNumber of times pregnant\nPlasma glucose concentration, 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test (not included in training)\nDiastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)\nTriceps skinfold thickness (mm)\n2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) (not included in training)\nBody mass index\nDiabetes pedigree function\nAge (years)\n\nAs you can notice that two variables were not included in the training process, this was due to the reason that the Glucose Tolerance Test (GTG) can give very inaccurate results when conducted at home using a blood sugar measuring device. And same is the case for finding the reading of 2-Hour serum Insulin.\nAs this project aims to provide regular Diabetes check-up for all women(above the age of 20 years) irrespective of their work engagement(house-wives and working women), it is not possible in all cases that user will have the required tools, skills, and experience to execute the required test at home. And hence the above features were eliminated from the training process.\nRequirements:\n\nThe user should know her general information(Age, Height, Weight, and Pregnancies)\nTo know the reading of Diastolic Blood Pressure, the user should have a Blood Pressure monitor like this which costs less than 100$\n\n\n\nTo know the Tricep Skinfold Thickness value, the user should have a Skinfold Caliper and take the reading in the following manner:\n\n\nThe cost of Skinfold Caliper is less than 4$\n\n\nIf the user do not know her Diabetes Pedigree Function, then it can be calculated on the web application using the following:\n\n\n\nReference\nThe user can input relative’s details(as much she knows) in the web-application, and Diabetes Pedigree Function will be calculated.\nNote that the value of the DPF increases as the number of relatives who developed DM increases, as the age at which those relatives developed DM decreases, and as the percentage of genes that they share with the subject increases. Also notice that the value of the DPF decreases as the number of relatives who never developed DM increases, as their ages at their last examinain increase, and as the percent of genes that they share with the subject increases.\nSteps for pre-processing data and training classifier:\n\nThe data has a very less number of 1s in Output(cases with positive diabetes), and hence this can affect the classifier’s accuracy to differentiate with 1s and 0s.\n\nDue to this reason, almost equal amount of data for 1s and 0s were taken in the training set(for which the data was divided into two parts on the same basis and then segregated for training data)\n\n\nNow the two data frames(with 1s and 0s) were concatenated so that they can be accessed easily\n\n\nFixing missing values(zeros in all other variables except ‘Pregnancies’):\n\n\nMissing values in  ‘Glucose’ =5 \nMissing values in  ‘BloodPressure’ =35 \nMissing values in  ‘SkinThickness’ =227 \nMissing values in  ‘Insulin’ =374 \nMissing values in  ‘BMI’ =11 \nMissing values in  ‘DiabetesPedigreeFunction’ =0 \nMissing values in  ‘Age’ =0\nThese values were fixed using the following algorithm:\nLet’s say a data frame has 3 variables as shown below:\n\nThe missing value is 1st value in Var1, now the 1st values of Var2 and Var3 are noted, which are 500 and 0.35 respectively. Now we try to find similar values (500, 0.35) in Var2 and Var3. Which in this case are 3rd value in Var2 and 0th value in Var3. The missing value is then replaced by the average of Var1 values at these positions(3rd and 0th). In this case: (89+81)/2 = 85= Var1(1)\nCode:\n\nThe above algorithm is used to fix missing values in the following way:\n\n\nGlucose values from similar Age and Outcome values (fix_miss_value(data, ""Glucose"", [""Age"", ""Outcome""])\n\n\nBloodPressure values from similar Age and Glucose values\n\n\nBMI values from similar Age, BloodPressure and Glucose values\n\n\nSkinThickness values from similar Age, Outcome, Glucose, BMI values\nThe rest variables used in training(Age and DiabetesPedigreeFunction) had no missing values.\n\n\nScaling us the DiabetesPedigreeFunction values:\nThese values were less than ‘1’ while the other values were greater than 1. And hence these values were multiplied by ‘100’.\n\n\nSplitting data into Training and Testing set:\n\nFor Training data, 300 entries with ‘0’ Outcome and 250 values with ‘1’ Outcome were taken. This collectively was 71% of the total data. Now the training data was ready.\nThe remaining 29% of data was further split into the 13% testing and 13% validation dataset.\n\n\n\nNeural Network Definition(model_architecture.py):\nNetwork(\n(fc1): Linear(in_features=6, out_features=40, bias=True)\n(fc2): Linear(in_features=40, out_features=81, bias=True)\n(fc3): Linear(in_features=81, out_features=36, bias=True)\n(fc4): Linear(in_features=36, out_features=19, bias=True)\n(out): Linear(in_features=19, out_features=2, bias=True)\n)\nThe training data was passed to the above Network and was trained for 1250 epochs. The best Trained Network which had the least validation loss was saved and was further used to made predictions on test data. The training accuracy given by the best model was 96.36% and the test accuracy was 85% (FeCare.ipynb)\nThe pickle file(\'FeCare.pkl\') of this best-trained model was saved and was further used to make predictions in the web-application.\n\n\nWeb-Application(app.py):\n\nGeneral Instructions to user for providing required inputs.\nA “Know” button for user to know how she can measure the Tricep Skinfold Thickness\nTaking the required inputs(except Diabetes Pedigree Function)\nInformation about what Diabetes Pedigree Function and how we can calculate that.\nTaking input of Diaetes Pedigree Function if user already knows, else taking inputs of the relatives information for calculating diabetes pedigree function\nA “Submit Info” button when the user is done inputting all the required information for calculating Diabetes Pedigree Function.\nAnd finally the “Results” button which will display weather the user has diabetes or not. If the user is found diabetic, the user is adviced to do Glucose - Tolerence Test(as next prefrence) at the nearest laboratory to confirm results.\n\n\nDemo(when Diabetes Pedigree Function is unknown)\n\n\n\nDemo(when Diabetes Pedigree Function is known)\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Rushanksavant', 'info_list': ['2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Oct 13, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Oct 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Swift', 'Updated Oct 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020', 'Updated Oct 27, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Oct 14, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Nov 9, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 19, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '175 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Diabetes\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/mefy-Aruna', 'info_list': ['2', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Oct 13, 2020', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Oct 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Swift', 'Updated Oct 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020', 'Updated Oct 27, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Oct 14, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Nov 9, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 19, 2020']}","{'location': 'Mumbai, India', 'stats_list': [['6', '          followers'], ['6', '          following'], ['7']], 'contributions': '658 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.\nAvailable Scripts\nIn the project directory, you can run:\nyarn start\nRuns the app in the development mode.\nOpen http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.\nThe page will reload if you make edits.\nYou will also see any lint errors in the console.\nyarn test\nLaunches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\nSee the section about running tests for more information.\nyarn build\nBuilds the app for production to the build folder.\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\nYour app is ready to be deployed!\nSee the section about deployment for more information.\nyarn eject\nNote: this is a one-way operation.

Ready to get started? Let’s learn how this all works by building and publishing your first GitHub Pages website!\nRepositories\nRight now, we’re in your first GitHub repository. A repository is like a folder or storage space for your project. Your project\'s repository contains all its files such as code, documentation, images, and more. It also tracks every change that you—or your collaborators—make to each file, so you can always go back to previous versions of your project if you make any mistakes.\nThis repository contains three important files: The HTML code for your first website on GitHub, the CSS stylesheet that decorates your website with colors and fonts, and the README file. It also contains an image folder, with one image file.\nDescribe your project\nYou are currently viewing your project\'s README file. README files are like cover pages or elevator pitches for your project. They are written in plain text or Markdown language, and usually include a paragraph describing the project, directions on how to use it, who authored it, and more.\nLearn more about READMEs\nYour first website\nGitHub Pages is a free and easy way to create a website using the code that lives in your GitHub repositories. You can use GitHub Pages to build a portfolio of your work, create a personal website, or share a fun project that you coded with the world. GitHub Pages is automatically enabled in this repository, but when you create new repositories in the future, the steps to launch a GitHub Pages website will be slightly different.\nLearn more about GitHub Pages\nRename this repository to publish your site\nWe\'ve already set-up a GitHub Pages website for you, based on your personal username. This repository is called hello-world, but you\'ll rename it to: username.github.io, to match your website\'s URL address. If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right.\nLet\'s get started! To update this repository’s name, click the Settings tab on this page. This will take you to your repository’s settings page.\n\nUnder the Repository Name heading, type: username.github.io, where username is your username on GitHub. Then click Rename—and that’s it. When you’re done, click your repository name or browser’s back button to return to this page.\n\nOnce you click Rename, your website will automatically be published at: https://your-username.github.io/. The HTML file—called index.html—is rendered as the home page and you\'ll be making changes to this file in the next step.\nCongratulations! You just launched your first GitHub Pages website. It\'s now live to share with the entire world\nMaking your first edit\nWhen you make any change to any file in your project, you’re making a commit. If you fix a typo, update a filename, or edit your code, you can add it to GitHub as a commit. Your commits represent your project’s entire history—and they’re all saved in your project’s repository.\nWith each commit, you have the opportunity to write a commit message, a short, meaningful comment describing the change you’re making to a file. So you always know exactly what changed, no matter when you return to a commit.\nPractice: Customize your first GitHub website by writing HTML code\nWant to edit the site you just published? Let’s practice commits by introducing yourself in your index.html file. Don’t worry about getting it right the first time—you can always build on your introduction later.\nLet’s start with this template:\n<p>Hello World! I’m [username]. This is my website!</p>\n\nTo add your introduction, copy our template and click the edit pencil icon at the top right hand corner of the index.html file.\n\nDelete this placeholder line:\n<p>Welcome to your first GitHub Pages website!</p>\n\nThen, paste the template to line 15 and fill in the blanks.\n\nWhen you’re done, scroll down to the Commit changes section near the bottom of the edit page. Add a short message explaining your change, like ""Add my introduction"", then click Commit changes.\n\nOnce you click Commit changes, your changes will automatically be published on your GitHub Pages website. Refresh the page to see your new changes live in action.\n🎉 You just made your first commit! 🎉\nExtra Credit: Keep on building!\nChange the placeholder Octocat gif on your GitHub Pages website by creating your own personal Octocat emoji or choose a different Octocat gif from our logo library here. Add that image to line 12 of your index.html file, in place of the <img src= link.\nWant to add even more code and fun styles to your GitHub Pages website? Follow these instructions to build a fully-fledged static website.\n\nEverything you need to know about GitHub\nGetting started is the hardest part. If there’s anything you’d like to know as you get started with GitHub, try searching GitHub Help. Our documentation has tutorials on everything from changing your repository settings to configuring GitHub from your command line.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/costafilhorcl', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 15, 2020', 'Updated Oct 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 18, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 18, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 13, 2020', '1', 'Updated Oct 20, 2020', 'Updated Oct 15, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['0', '          followers'], ['1', '          following'], ['14']], 'contributions': '24 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Diabetes_classification\nStudy of Pipeline to predict diabetes outcome from a set of features.\nSource code taken from a Kaggle nb -

It is a very unique and sensitive drug that requires administering and screening the drug over at least 5-7 days of time in the hospital with frequent monitoring/testing and patient medication adherence training with a mobile application. You have been provided a patient dataset from a client partner and are tasked with building a predictive model that can identify which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on. Target patients are people that are likely to be in the hospital for this duration of time and will not incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring.\nIn order to achieve your goal you must build a regression model that can predict the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and use this to select/filter patients for your study.\nExpected Hospitalization Time Regression Model: Utilizing a synthetic dataset(denormalized at the line level augmentation) built off of the UCI Diabetes readmission dataset, students will build a regression model that predicts the expected days of hospitalization time and then convert this to a binary prediction of whether to include or exclude that patient from the clinical trial.\nThis project will demonstrate the importance of building the right data representation at the encounter level, with appropriate filtering and preprocessing/feature engineering of key medical code sets. This project will also require students to analyze and interpret their model for biases across key demographic groups.\nDataset\nDue to healthcare PHI regulations (HIPAA, HITECH), there are limited number of publicly available datasets and some datasets require training and approval. So, for the purpose of this exercise, we are using a dataset from UC Irvine that has been modified for this course. Please note that it is limited in its representation of some key features such as diagnosis codes which are usually an unordered list in 835s/837s (the HL7 standard interchange formats used for claims and remits).\n\nhttps://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008\n\nGetting Started\nFollow the instructions in starter_code/student_project.ipynb and be sure to set up your Anaconda environment to get started!\nDependencies\nUsing Anaconda consists of the following:\n\nInstall miniconda on your computer, by selecting the latest Python version for your operating system. If you already have conda or miniconda installed, you should be able to skip this step and move on to step 2.\nCreate and activate * a new conda environment.\n\n* Each time you wish to work on any exercises, activate your conda environment!\n\n1. Installation\nDownload the latest version of miniconda that matches your system.\n\n\n\n\nLinux\nMac\nWindows\n\n\n\n\n64-bit\n64-bit (bash installer)\n64-bit (bash installer)\n64-bit (exe installer)\n\n\n32-bit\n32-bit (bash installer)\n\n32-bit (exe installer)\n\n\n\nInstall miniconda on your machine. Detailed instructions:\n\nLinux: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#linux-miniconda-install\nMac: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#os-x-miniconda-install\nWindows: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#windows-miniconda-install\n\n2. Create and Activate the Environment\nFor Windows users, these following commands need to be executed from the Anaconda prompt as opposed to a Windows terminal window. For Mac, a normal terminal window will work.\nGit and version control\nThese instructions also assume you have git installed for working with Github from a terminal window, but if you do not, you can download that first with the command:\nconda install git\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about version control and using git from the command line, take a look at our free course: Version Control with Git.\nNow, we're ready to create our local environment!\n\nClone the repository, and navigate to the downloaded folder. This may take a minute or two to clone due to the included image data.\n\ngit clone https://github.com/udacity/nd320-c1-emr-data-starter.git\ncd nd320-c1-emr-data-starter\n\n\n\nCreate (and activate) a new environment, named udacity-ehr-env with Python 3.7. If prompted to proceed with the install (Proceed [y]/n) type y.\n\nLinux or Mac:\n\nconda create -n udacity-ehr-env python=3.7\nsource activate udacity-ehr-env\n\n\nWindows:\n\nconda create --name udacity-ehr-env python=3.7\nactivate udacity-ehr-env\n\nAt this point your command line should look something like: (udacity-ehr-env) <User>:USER_DIR <user>$. The (udacity-ehr-env) indicates that your environment has been activated, and you can proceed with further package installations.\n\n\nInstall a few required pip packages, which are specified in the requirements text file. Be sure to run the command from the project root directory since the requirements.txt file is there.\n\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\nLicense\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Toulik-Das', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Updated Nov 23, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 18, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 26, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020', 'C#', 'Updated Oct 13, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['5', '          followers'], ['0', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '108 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['AutoML on Kaggle dataset\nAutoML using TPOT (evolutionary algorithm) based metaheuristic for optimising hyper-parameters.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Xalt8', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Updated Nov 23, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 18, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 26, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020', 'C#', 'Updated Oct 13, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['10', '          followers'], ['0', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '106 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/SmartPracticeschool', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Updated Nov 23, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 18, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 26, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020', 'C#', 'Updated Oct 13, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '7 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/CuteExecute', 'info_list': ['Python', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Updated Nov 23, 2020', 'C++', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 18, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 26, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020', 'C#', 'Updated Oct 13, 2020']}"

According to a CDC report in 2017, more than 100 million Americans are now living with diabetes or prediabetes, which can eventually result in serious health complications including premature death, vision loss, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure. For this reason, our group decides to explore a dataset to identify the main factors causing diabetes among a group of patients belonging to the Pima Indian heritage (subgroup of Native Americans).\nOVERVIEW\nSource of data:  https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database\nThis dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

You can read more about the data and the variables here.\nPart 1:\nI read in the diabetes.csv dataset.\nPart 2:\nI Split the data into train and test holding out 50% of observations as the test set. Pass random_state=0 to train_test_split to ensure I get the same train and tests sets as the solution.\nPart 3:\nHere are some question for you:\n\n\nDoes LogisticRegression use a penalty by default? If yes, what penalty? If it does, does this mean that LogisticRegression actually uses ridge regression or the LASSO as the default?\n\n\nWhat is the interpretation of the parmater C? How does it relate to the regularization strength  𝜆 ?\n\n\nIf you want to use a regularization strengh of 2 (i.e.  𝜆=2 ), what value of C would you pass?\n\n\nYou can fine the answers to these questions in the jupyter notebook I provided: ""Classification with Logistic Regression.ipynb""\nPart 4:\nHere, I create a pipeline for logistic regression (that is, the unpenalized version). I need to choose an alternative solver for LogisticRegression since the default solver does not support the no penalty option. So I used solver=""newton-cg"",\nIf you get a warning about convergence of coef_, try increasing the max_iter parameter. I used max_iter=10000 and it works fine.\nPart 5:\nI used my model to construct a confusion matrix by fitting and predicting on the training data.\nHere I specify my model\'s training accuracy, precision, and recall.\nPart 6:\nI estimate logistic regressions out of sample recall by using 5 fold cross validation.\nThen, I create a new pipeline for either an l2 penalty in logistic regression or an l1 penalty. It should be noted that penalized models perform best when we scale the inputs. So I add StandardScaler() to my pipeline.\nI used sklearn\'s GridSearchCV to search over the regulatization strength ranging from 0.01 to 10 in 25 evenly spaced increments for my model. I used recall as the metric for scoring.\nPart 7:\nHere, I print the cross validated recall for mt regularized model by accessing the best model\'s score by performing lasso_gscv.best_score_.\nPart 8:\nI prrint out the C parameter for the regualized model.\nHere are some questions for you:\n\n\nFrom this value what is the regularization strength  𝜆 ?\n\n\nWould you prefer a regularized model for this dataset? When might a regularized model make more sense?\n\n\nPart 9:\nLASSO and other penalized estimators make the assumption that the model is what we call sparse (that means, not every variable is actually related to the outcome). We can see which variables are more important than others by examining what is known as the coefficient paths.\nHere are the steps to create the coefficient path:\n\n\nInitialize an array of regularization strengths (typically going from something very small, maybe 0.1, to something very large, maybe 100.\n\n\nFor each regularization strength, fit your model. Keep track of the coefficients.\n\n\nPlot the coefficient values against the log of the regularization strength.\n\n\nHere, I construct the coefficient path for logistic regression with an l1 penalty.\nYou should note that you can determine which coefficient is most strongly related to the outcome be examining which coefficent reaches 0 last.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/MahtabEK', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Oct 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020', 'Updated Oct 12, 2020', 'R', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 14, 2020', '2', 'Updated Oct 13, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['1', '          follower'], ['0', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '4 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': [""Interview\nSELECT\tPatientTable.Fname.\nPatientTable.Lname,\nPatientTable.Age,\nPatientTable.COF1,\tPatientTable.DC1,\tPatientTable.DDesc1,\nPatientTable.COF2,\tPatientTable.DC2,\tPatientTable.DDesc2,\nPatientTable.COF3,\tPatientTable.DC3,\tPatientTable.DDesc3,\nPatientTable.COF4,\tPatientTable.DC4,\tPatientTable.DDesc4,\nPatientTable.COF5,\tPatientTable.DC5,\tPatientTable.DDesc5, .......

Furthermore, as my application details, I am more of data manager and research analyst than programmer, and in particular I am very aware of the clinical issues from my biomedical science background. Furthermore my answers to the application questionnaires indicate that I have not used particular software developmental methods since starting my recent Doctoral thesis work in 2015. So while I am able to manage and understand the medical information projects I would need more time for developing applications with particular programming languages that I have not used.\n\nWhich part of the solution consumed the most amount of time?\n\nThe parts of the solution that consumed a lot of time included understanding the details of what was required. When reading the advertisement I understood that the position was for the lead developer for both data research and operational data. So rather than an IT person I had expected the role to focus on the medical and analytical issues (including research analysis) and so a biomedical science and hospital performance knowledge would be relevant. The lead person could then discuss with the IT staff the appropriate systems, which I am very adaptable to as my work history demonstrates.  On the other hand this exam / test appears to be more about programming rather than examining the clinical issues etc.\n\nWhat would you suggest to the customer that they may not have thought of in regards to their request?\n\nThere are a few things in the design of this project that may have some issues. One is the readmissions. So as an example if we just rely on name and birth date to ID the episode on patient episode may be connected with others with regards tot he ICD coding or pathology testing. Even the imaging may be outdated and need redoing, for example. So the linking should include the dates of the activities or the admission number to link the patient information and the DRG / ICD codes for example.  Other things of interest could include admission type (emergency etc) and discharge type (if the patient has been discharged) as well as readmissions (particularly emergency readmission within a set time period for the same diagnosis). As well the outpatient data, including allied health follow up, would be significant in some cases, such as diabetes etc.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/MixStatics', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 12, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Oct 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 16, 2020', 'Updated Oct 12, 2020', 'R', 'MIT license', 'Updated Oct 17, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 14, 2020', '2', 'Updated Oct 13, 2020']}",,,
