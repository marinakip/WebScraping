Different methods and procedures of cleaning the data, feature extraction, feature engineering and algorithms to predict the onset of diabetes are used based for diagnostic measure on Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.\nKeywords\nmachine learning; Pima Indians Diabetes dataset; binary classification; features; feature extraction; feature engineering; support vector machine; MLP; neural netwroks; Decision tree; Linear regression heat map; pairplot; violin plot; feature importance.\nDatabase - Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset\nPima Indian Diabetes dataset has 9 attributes in total. All the person in records are females and the number of pregnancies they have had has been recorded as the first attribute of the dataset. Second is the value of Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test and then is the Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), fourth in line is the Triceps skin fold thickness (mm), then is the 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml), sixth is Body mass index (weight in kg/ (height in m) ^2) and then seventh is the Diabetes pedigree function and the second last value is the that of the Age (years). The ninth column is that of the Class variable (0 or 1), 0 for no diabetes and 1 for the presence. To start with we first take a description of the dataset. We infer not much from this except the facts like we have a data datset of 768 lines and the maximum values of the Age and Pregnancies. Nothing more is of much use for the prediction. We also calculated the number of datsets that were positive to the test of diabetes and those who were negetive and the value came out to be 268 and 500 respectively. We decided to take the mean value of BMI and found that the average value of a person suffering from the disease has mean BMI value as 35.14 which means that they are not healthy and obese. It is also interesting to note that the mean BMI value for the people who are not suffering from the disease is 30 which is the threshold value of people becoming obese. The mean value of the second parameter Glucose (Plasma glucose concentration) was done we found that those who suffered from the disease had mean value as 141.25 which indicates pre-diabetic state of hyperglycaemia that is associated with insulin resistance and increased risk of cardiovascular pathology.\nMethodology\nA. A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements. Decision trees are commonly used in operations research, specifically in decision analysis, to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal, but are also a popular tool in machine learning.\nDecision tree algorithm follows:\n• The attribute/feature best for set is taken as root\n• Distribute the set into different sets having same attribute values for particular value.\n• Repeat the above steps till we get to the leaf nodes of the tree where no further division can take place.\nB. In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression. (This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.)\nC. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network. An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable.\nD. In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyse data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\nConclusion\nWe applied many algorithms and did a lot of feature manipulation and extraction. We got the best accuracy of 80.5% using SVM. A lot of information about the dataset was also extracted without using complex algorithms. We were also able to perform a lot of exploratory data analysis and came to many conclusions. Random Forest and Ensemble Learning can probably find a better result. Our result was also very close to the best result found and this shows that at the right parameters SVM can be a good and practical choice to classify a medical data.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/RaviRai1311', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 14, 2020', 'Updated May 17, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 30, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'R', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jul 16, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'Boston', 'stats_list': [['2', '          followers'], ['17', '          following'], ['6']], 'contributions': '47 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['diabetes-project\nTo examine the association between various potential risk factors  and diabetes among JHS (Jackson Heart Study)participants\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/yuehcode', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 14, 2020', 'Updated May 17, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 30, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'R', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jul 16, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'Gurgaon, Haryana', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '76 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Diabetes-Predictor\nIt will give your diabetes report whether you are suffering from diabetes or not.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/vivekbhoj007', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 14, 2020', 'Updated May 17, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 30, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'R', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jul 16, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['0', '          followers'], ['2', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '26 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Aadharprasai33', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 14, 2020', 'Updated May 17, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 30, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'R', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jul 16, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['1', '          follower'], ['1', '          following'], ['10']], 'contributions': '229 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning\nUsing The Concept Of Logistic Regression ,I Tried To Predict Whether A person suffers From Diabetes Or Not, By Analysis Of Diabetes Dataset.\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/rohan-007', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 14, 2020', 'Updated May 17, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 30, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'R', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jul 16, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['1', '          follower'], ['0', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '16 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/aniketpandey23', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 14, 2020', 'Updated May 17, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 30, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'R', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jul 16, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 11, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 12, 2020']}"

Professor David Steier at Heinz College of Carnegie Mellon University in the spring of 2020. Our project explores the patient data from Clinica del Azucar (CdA), which is located in Mexico city. The goal of the analysis was to explore the data to find patterns that help us predict the engagement level of patients. Through our analysis, we showed that the frequency and timing of nutritional visits is an important factor that helps patients to manage their diabetes. In our final report, we summarized our findings from the initial EDA,  prediction analysis, proposal of intervention and discussed how we evaluated our intervention. Our conclusion is that it is possible to affect the engagement through behavioral interventions. We evaluated the effect of our intervention on engagement level and demonstrated that it is possible to help the target population to improve the patient outcomes. Our recommendation is that CdA test the intervention on a small set of patients and if successful could be scaled up to a low-engagement population.  The future work could explore more feature variables that are hiding in the comments and text strings of the dataset and tease out the main findings from these notes to improve the behavioral interventions.

The characteristic of diabetes is that the blood glucose is higher than the normal level, which is caused by defective insulin secretion or its impaired biological effects, or both (Lonappan et al., 2007). Diabetes can lead to chronic damage and dysfunction of various tissues, especially eyes, kidneys, heart, blood vessels and nerves (Krasteva et al., 2011).\nWith the development of living standards, diabetes is increasingly common in people's daily life. According to the growing morbidity in recent years, in 2040, the world's diabetic patients will reach 642 million, which means that one of the ten adults in the future is suffering from diabetes.\nTherefore, how to diagnose and analyze diabetes is a topic worthy studying quickly and accurately. The earlier diagnosis is obtained, the much easier we can control it. Machine learning can help people make a preliminary judgment about diabetes mellitus according to their daily physical examination data, and it can serve as a reference for doctors (Lee and Kim, 2016; Alghamdi et al., 2017; Kavakiotis et al., 2017). For machine learning method, how to select the valid features and the correct classifier are the most important problems.\nData\nThis Dataset( Please click here to view the dataset) is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\nThe datasets consist of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.\nHypothesis:\n\nDiabetes during pregnancy has increased in recent years. From 2000 to 2010, the percentage of pregnant women with gestational diabetes increased 56%\nAny increase in BMI above normal weight levels is associated with an increased risk of being diagnosed as having complications of diabetes mellitus.\n\nGoal\nMy goal is to build a machine learning model to predict patients with diagnosed diabetes based on the given information in the dataset also to help doctors in early disease detection, early detection saves lives and improve health!\nReferences:\n\nAlghamdi M., Al-Mallah M., Keteyian S., Brawner C., Ehrman J., Sakr S.

Since, there has always been shortage of resources in medical industry whether it is hospital bed, medicines and other equipment due to large number of patients, so it is always advisable to keep the tab of patients that might use the resources in future. Our model will provide the predictions in terms of whether patient will be prescribed diabetic medication or not can really help the doctors and medical staff to keep the proper tab of patient’s health and avoid diabetic condition. This model will also determine if patient needs to be readmitted in hospital based on clinical history, medication and other factors which can help the medical staff to properly maintain and utilize medical resources as per the necessity and availability.\nThe dataset represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It is sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository and has been prepared to analyze factors related to readmission as well as other outcomes pertaining to patients with diabetes. (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008).\nThe data contains more than 1,00,000 instances and 50 attributes. The dataset is multivariate in terms of its characteristics, whereas the attributes are numerical and nominal.\nFollowing are some of the tasks that I am going to perform in our data model:\n\n\nWe will use binary classification technique to determine whether the patient is given diabetic medication or not, since this label is classified into Yes or No. We will use Random Forest classifier for the above classification technique as it is the best algorithm for working with dataset having large number of attributes and it handles unbalanced data in a better way.\n\n\nThe number of readmission times are categorized into three classes as no re-admission, less than 30 days and more than 30 days. Thus, we will use various multi classification techniques such as K means clustering and Random Forest classifier to determine whether the patient is re-admitted or not as they are best algorithms for working with large number of attributes and can handle unbalanced data in a better way.\n\n\nFollowing are some steps in evaluating above model:\n\n\nThe proposed dataset has some noisy and missing data which will be treated with proper preprocessing techniques like missing value imputation, normalization methods or standardization methods.\n\n\nAs there are large number of instances (approximately 0.1 million), hold out evaluation will be used to obtain the training and test dataset. We will split the data into 80-20 ratio i.e training set (80%) and test set (20%) and will start building the model using training data.\n\n\nWe will build different models and evaluate them using accuracy score or confusion matrix to get the best working algorithm.\n\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/rainapra', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 18, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated May 16, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 17, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated May 17, 2020', 'R', 'Updated May 14, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 12, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'Updated May 17, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 15, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['0', '          followers'], ['0', '          following'], ['1']], 'contributions': '33 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Diabetes Prediction on pima indian tribe using Machine Learning\nLibraries use: Numpy,Pandas,Sklearn\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Niranjan16', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 18, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated May 16, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 17, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated May 17, 2020', 'R', 'Updated May 14, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 12, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'Updated May 17, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 15, 2020']}","{'location': 'Belgium', 'stats_list': [['1', '          follower'], ['3', '          following'], ['7']], 'contributions': '27 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['DiaBites\nApp for helping out making decisions in our sons Diabetes treatment\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/stijnbrouwers', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 18, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated May 16, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 17, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated May 17, 2020', 'R', 'Updated May 14, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 12, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'Updated May 17, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 15, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '5 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/vpros7253', 'info_list': ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 18, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'GPL-3.0 license', 'Updated May 16, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 17, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated May 17, 2020', 'R', 'Updated May 14, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 12, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated May 16, 2020', 'Updated May 17, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 15, 2020']}","{'location': 'Uberlândia / Brasil', 'stats_list': [['0', '          followers'], ['9', '          following'], ['6']], 'contributions': '78 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': [""Logistic-Regression\nDiabetes and heart disease are two of the most expensive and prevalent chronic conditions that affect patients in countries like the United States and Brazil, leading the healthcare industry to spend billions each year to treat and manage these disorders.\nAs care delivery continues to evolve from reactive disease treatment to preventive and proactive care, more organizations are looking to advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to help draw actionable conclusions from their big data resources.\nWith machine learning methods, we can process large amounts of data and examine the many factors involved in predicting a future outcome.\nWith machine learning algorithms, however, suppliers can design personalized interventions for each patient, from increased monitoring to modified treatment plans.
