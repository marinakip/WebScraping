For diabetes; the cost analysis estimates that $250 million can be saved across 98,000 diabetic patients by incorporating predictive modeling and prompting greater attention to those who were predicted to get readmitted. Hospital readmission rates are an indicator of hospital quality as well as a means to reduce healthcare costs. High readmission rate is an indication of poor hospital quality, poor treatment and results in the hospital getting penalized. Hence by identifying the factors that lead to higher readmission and being able to predict if a patient is going to be readmitted, the treatment provided by the hospital can be changed, to avoid a readmission and thereby the quality of healthcare provided to the patient can be largely improved, as well as billions of dollars can be saved.\nData Science Methodology\nBy leveraging the dataset, we will perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis and perform feature engineering to identify the suitable attributes that are having significant effects on the target variable i.e readmission. After doing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection, we can build Classification and Clustering Machine Learning models in order to predict whether the patient is going to be readmitted or not. We are planning on implementing Classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, Feedforward Neural network, etc. and clustering techniques like Kmeans and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithms in order to produce the optimum number of clusters. We will then go ahead with the clustering algorithm that produces clusters with the highest purity and least entropy. Extensive model fine-tuning can be done in order to build a model with the best accuracy and recall. The recall is more important in this case as it is very important to minimize Recall by reducing the False Negatives, as incorrectly classifying a patient as ‘Not Readmitted’ when he/she is going to be readmitted can be very problematic and is highly undesirable.\nProject Objective\nThe objective of the project is to help the hospitals accurately predict if a patient is going to get readmitted after discharge. The predictions made will help the hospital make informed decisions on the necessary treatment process alterations in order to reduce patient readmission rate. In this context, you can see different objective functions for the problem. We have to try to figure out situations where the patient will not be readmitted, or if they are going to be readmitted in less than 30 days. Make your choice and let's help them create new approaches for the problem. We will try to predict which factors are more important in determining if a patient might get readmitted within 30 days.\nExpected Results\nBy accurately predicting if a patient is going to be readmitted, the hospital will be able to (taking into account the patient demographics, the treatment procedure and medicines) make necessary treatment changes to avoid the patient readmission. This reduction in patient readmission rate will help the hospital save billions of dollars and also improve their customer rating. The process of EDA followed by model building, fine tuning and performance evaluation is an iterative process which can be carried out until the best and desirable results are achieved.\nDataset Source\nPrediction on Hospital Readmission Classification using Diabetes dataset is obtained from the UCI ML Repository. The data set represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. The data has around 100k+ observations and 50 attributes. The data contains categorical attributes such as race, admission type, insulin, medical specialty of admitting, etc. and binary variables such as gender, change, diabetes Medicine and numeric variables like age, time in hospital, number of lab test performed, number of medication, number of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits in the year before the hospitalization. The target variable has 3 different classes which are “No readmission”, “A readmission in less than 30 days” & “A readmission in more than 30 days”.\n\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Laxman-Kumar', 'info_list': ['3', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 18, 2020', '1', 'Updated Mar 19, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 9, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 19, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '2 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Diabetes\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/CleversonCachoeira', 'info_list': ['3', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 18, 2020', '1', 'Updated Mar 19, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 9, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 19, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '1 contribution\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/thiruvil75', 'info_list': ['3', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 18, 2020', '1', 'Updated Mar 19, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 9, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 19, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['0', '          followers'], ['1', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '22 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/satya1225', 'info_list': ['3', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 18, 2020', '1', 'Updated Mar 19, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 9, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 19, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['3', '          followers'], ['2', '          following'], ['17']], 'contributions': '35 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/saumya18csu194', 'info_list': ['3', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 18, 2020', '1', 'Updated Mar 19, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 9, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 19, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '4 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Control\nDiabetes control\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Andygoodbloke', 'info_list': ['3', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 18, 2020', '1', 'Updated Mar 19, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated May 9, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 19, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020']}","{'location': 'Canada', 'stats_list': [['25', '          followers'], ['22', '          following'], ['143']], 'contributions': '1,314 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': [""pure_diabetes\nRepo for PURE diabetes project\nInstructions for running the Jupyter notebook:\njust make sure you do the following:\n\nssh chenj4@risctrlp1\nbash\nXDG_RUNTIME_DIR='' srun --nodelist=RICREATET1 --mem=16G -c 4 jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0\nhttp://ricreatet1:8888/tree WITH THE TOKEN GENERATED FROM SRUN\n\nIf ricreate1 is down then we could tunnel the traffic back to THIS RDP comp!\nActually, we can simply use a technical solution!

It affects different organs of the human body which thus harm a large number of the body's system, in particular the blood veins and nerves. Early prediction in such disease can be controlled and save human life. To achieve the goal, this research work mainly explores various risk factors related to this disease using machine learning techniques. Machine learning techniques provide efficient result to extract knowledge by constructing predicting models from diagnostic medical datasets collected from the diabetic patients. Extracting knowledge from such data can be useful to predict diabetic patients. In this work, we employ four popular machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and C4.5 Decision Tree, on adult population data to predict diabetic mellitus.

In fact low and middle income countries currently hold 75% of all diabetic patients. As the number of diabetic patients continues to increase, this inequity become more significant and overhwleming. As of 2018, there are over 425 million diabetics globally. By 2045, this number is predicted to increase to 635 million! As the world braces for this tremendous increase in diabetes (as well as all the associated complications and comorbidities), some countries will be more significantly affected than others.\nThis begs the question, how are rates of diabetes changing in countries around the world? What are some common factors among countries seeing the biggest increase? I used data from the Global Health Data Exchange to analyze the incidence and effect of diabetes globally, and find answers to these questions.\nData Analysis\nFirst the Global Health Data Exchange data set containing the diabetes incidence rate in 2017 for 196 countries was downloaded. Then a cluster analysis was conducted in order to identify groups of nations. This analysis yielded 5 clusters and identified 14 countries facing the highest incidence rates of diabetes. In order of incidence rate, these countries are:  Fiji, Kiribati, American Samoa, Mauritis, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Malta, Northern Mariana Islands, Bahrain, Tonga, Portugal, United Arab Emirates, Trinidad and Tobago, and Denmark. The analysed data set can be found here\nThen, overall disease burden data for the American Samoa and the United States of America was downloaded. This showed both 2017 data and percentage change from 1993-2017. These data sets were analyzed using JupyterLabs Python notebook. Pivot tables were created to quickly analyze the data and compare the top contributers to overall disease burden in both countries. Type 2 Diabetes was the biggest contributer to disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in the American Samoa but was not even in the top 5 for the United States.\nIn order to compare the effect of diabetes in these countries, a dataset detailing diabetes incidence rates between 1993-2017 and another detailing diabetes deaths between 1993-2017 for the American Samoa, the United States and the global averages were downloaded. These were plotted to identify trends over time and can  be seen in the images below.\n\n\nDiscussion\nAnalysis of the initial data question, how are rates of diabetes changing around the world, found that 7 of the 10 nations with the fastest growing rate of diabetes are from the Oceania region. Furthermore, two of these nations are considered territories of the United States, the country that spends the greatest amount of money on healthcare globally. The United States also has a significant rate of diabetes, but is not in this top cluster of nations. This begged the question, how do overall disease burdens in the United States and the American Somoa differ? Why are the outcomes for these nations so different? These are important questions for policy makers, public health officials, and those who care about health equity issues to consider. From the graphs above, it is clear that though a bit higher than the global average, the United States still sees significantly lower rates of both diabetes incidence and deaths than the American Samoa. The American Samoa is seeing an extremely troubling increase in these rates over the years, greater even than the already troubling increases globally. Given the relatively small overall population of the American Samoa, the number of diabetic patients may seem small. However, it is critical that this increase in the rate is taken seriously. When a significant portion of the population is suffering from diabetes, this can increase the impact faced by healthcare systems exponentially due to the care required for comorbidities and complications. Routine surgical procedures become more risky, annual checkups become more important, and money spent on medications increases.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/njeeva', 'info_list': ['1', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Mar 16, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 27, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 18, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Oct 23, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '39 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Detection-of-diabetes\nIntroduction\nDiabetes is a chronic health problem with devastating, yet preventable consequences. It is characterized by high blood glucose levels resulting from defects in insulin production, insulin action, or both. Globally, rates of type 2 diabetes were 15.1 million in 2000, the number of people with diabetes worldwide is projected to increase to 36.6 million by 2030.Along with the increase in incidence of diabetes, both individual and societal expectations concerning the management of diabetes have also increased, with many reports from The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), United States Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) urging patients to “Take Charge of Your Diabetes” and “Conquer Diabetes”. One of the main goals of USDHHS’s report, Healthy People 2010, is to improve the quality of life for persons with diabetes.Despite the technological and scientific advances made toward the treatment of diabetes, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists reports that only 1 in 3 patients with type 2 diabetes is well controlled.\nMotivation\nAs a research group, we wanted to do our undergraduate thesis on a research that will assist a huge amount of people in their healthy lives. The number of people with diabetic retinopathy is growing higher day by day. It is estimated that the number will grow from 126.6 million to 191.0 million by 2030 and the number with vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) will increase from 37.3 million to 56.3 million, if any proper action is not taken. Despite growing evidence documenting the effectiveness of routine DR screening and early treatment, it is frequently leads to poor visual functioning and represents the leading cause of blindness. Most of the time it has been neglected in health care and in many low income countries because of inadequate medical service. While researching about these factors we get motivated to work with this topic. As there is insufficient ways to detect about diabetic retinopathy, we will build a system which will give prediction about diabetic retinopathy. Thus, we decided to use Machine Learning Algorithms for the prediction of this disease.\nObjectives\nThis thesis mainly focuses on the prediction of diabetic and analysis performed of different algorithm for the prediction. Machine learning algorithms such as KNN, GBM, SVM, Random Forest etc. can be trained by providing training datasets to them and then these algorithms can predict the data by comparing the provided data with the training datasets. Our objective is to train our algorithm by providing training datasets to it and our goal is to detect diabetic affected using different types of classification algorithms.\nContribution\nOur objective is to train our algorithm by providing training datasets to it and our goal is to detect diabetic retinopathy using different types of classification algorithms. Here we split our dataset using cross validation so that we can train our data perfectly. And we reduce our data feature which is unnecessary. For that our model is so faster and give perfect accuracy. We also use different classification algorithm for training and test our data.\nData Description\nOur dataset contains different types of features that is extracted from the csv file. This dataset is used to predict whether a human contains signs of diabetic retinopathy or not. The value here represents different point of retina of diabetic patients. First 9 columns in the dataset are independent variables or input column and last column is dependent variables or output column. Outputs are represented by binary numbers. “1” means the patient has diabetic retinopathy and “0” means absence of the disease.\nData preprocessing:\n\nTo remove unwanted data from the dataset.\nTo fill-up NaN data by taking mean or median value of that attribute\nNormalize the data\nTaking important attribute (Feature Reduction) for better accuracy\nStandardize the data\nK-fold cross validation\nAfter preprocessing, we fit different model. we observe that the accuracy of the both training and testing set is quite similar and for both training and testing dataset GBM algorithm is giving higher accuracy rate which is around 90%.So, we can say that this algorithm will give us more accurate prediction about the disease. As our main purpose of the thesis is to build a model which will classify the diabetic retinopathy as accurate as possible, we hope that this final model will give us proper and appropriate results.\n\nExperiments and Results\nIn the previous chapter we have discussed about proposed system of our thesis. Now we discussing about the results we obtained from our experiments upon the implementation of this system. We have divided our dataset into two parts- training and testing dataset. In this chapter we will show the outcome of the training and testing dataset. First, we trained our dataset with these four algorithms and then we built a model. Then, we tested our testing dataset in this model. If the test set accuracy is near to train set accuracy then we can conclude that we built a good model. We have total 913 data of different individual in our dataset. There are 913 rows and 10 columns in the dataset. After splitting the data into two parts now we have 700 rows for train data and for test data we have 213 rows.\nTraining & Test Accuracy of SVM Algorithm\nFor SVM algorithm we got training accuracy of 100% but our testing accuracy is 70.07%. We know Support Vector Machines a classifier that is defined using a separation hyper plane between the classes. But for our training dataset the accuracy of SVM is 82.01% which is not quite satisfactory. For that again we take some important feature from the dataset and again fit our dataset. For that we find the training accuracy 87.33% and test accuracy is 81.00%.\nTraining & Test Accuracy of KNN Algorithm\nFor KNN algorithm our training accuracy is 83.02% but testing accuracy is 75%. When KNN is used for classification, the out can be calculated as the class with the highest frequency from k-most similar instances. As we want to classify our result into two part we decided to use this algorithm. . For that again we take some important feature from the dataset and again fit our dataset. For that we find the training accuracy 84.01% and test accuracy is 79.08%.\nTraining Accuracy of GBM Algorithm\nFor GBM our training accuracy 100% but testing accuracy is 75.08%. We see that the accuracy result of KNN and Random Forest is quite close. For that again we take some important feature from the dataset and again fit our dataset. For that we find the training accuracy 100% and test accuracy is 90.05%.\nResults Analysis\nAfter training the model we test the model with the testing dataset. We have 20% data for testing in the testing set. In the below we shows the training accuracy and testing accuracy for all algorithms\nConclusion\nWe have tried to construct an ensemble to predict if a patient has diabetic retinopathy using features from retinal photos. After training and testing the model the accuracy we get is quite similar. For both sets GBM is providing higher accuracy rate for predicting DR. Despite the shortcomings in reaching good performance results, this work provided a means to make use and test multiple machine learning algorithms and try to arrive to ensemble models that would outperform individual learners. It also allowed exploring a little feature selection, feature generation, parameter selection and experiences the constraints in computation time when looking for possible candidate models in high combinatorial spaces, even for a small dataset as the one used. The structure of our research has been built in such a way that with proper dataset and minor alternation it can work to classify the disease in any number of categories.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Jahidul-Afrad', 'info_list': ['1', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Mar 16, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 27, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 18, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Oct 23, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '34 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/diananiti', 'info_list': ['1', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Mar 16, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 27, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 18, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Oct 23, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020']}","{'location': 'Harvard University', 'stats_list': [['3', '          followers'], ['0', '          following'], ['4']], 'contributions': '62 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Diabetes-Classifier-Neural-Network-\nUsed Keras to build a binary Diabetes Classifier with a precision of roughly 90%\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/HackerHassan', 'info_list': ['1', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Mar 16, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 27, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 18, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Oct 23, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['0', '          followers'], ['2', '          following'], ['6']], 'contributions': '61 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/YuFengZzza', 'info_list': ['1', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Mar 16, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 20, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 22, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 27, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 18, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Oct 23, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Mar 17, 2020']}"

Sebab dari para testimoni sebagian besar para penderita diabetes bisa teratasi dengan bantuan produk obat diabetes ini. Diabetes bukan penyakit yang tidak dapat disembuhkan. Di dalam artikel ini akan diulas apa penyebab, gejala dan obat herbal diabetes melitus yang ampuh untuk mengatasi masalah penyakit Anda. Diabetes Melitus atau kencing manis secara umum diartikan dengan meningkatnya kadar gula dalam darah. Orang yang mengidap penyakit diabetes memiliki kadar glukosa dalam darah yang tinggi, yang juga disebut gula darah tinggi atau hiperglikemia. Diabetes ialah suatu jenis penyakit kronis yang secara perlahan akan mematikan pengidapnya jika tidak diatasi dan diberikan pengobatan yang tepat dan cepat. Orang yang menderita penyakit diabetes mesti selalu menerapkan gaya hidup sehat seperti berolahraga secara teratur, mengkonsumsi makanan sehat, tidak mengkonsumsi makanan yang mengandung banyak gula, menjaga kebersihan tubuh dan lingkungan serta mengkonsumsi obat herbal diabetes melitus yang tepat. Tindakan seperti ini amat dibutuhkan buat mencegah dan meminimalisir munculnya bahaya dan komplikasi penyakit diabetes.   Penyebab Diabetes Melitus  Banyak ahli medis maupun herbalis yang mengatakan bahwa penyakit diabetes melitus tidak dapat disembuhkan, hanya dapat dijaga kadar gulanya agar selalu dalam ambang batas normal. Apakah benar demikian? Untuk mengetahui jawabannya kita harus tahu akar permasalahan dari penyakit ini. Diabetes adalah akibat dari gangguan metabolisme di dalam tubuh. Tubuh manusia akan mencerna makanan yang masuk ke dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi.     LAYANAN KONSULTASI DAN PEMESANAN WA : 081 903 555 115    Caranya dengan memecah karbohidrat dan gula untuk dijadikan glukosa. Dengan bantuan hormon insulin, sel-sel di seluruh tubuh lalu menyerap glukosa dan menggunakannya untuk energi. Diabetes terjadi ketika tubuh tidak membuat cukup insulin ( diabetes tipe 1 ) atau tidak dapat menggunakan insulin secara efektif / resistensi insulin ( diabetes tipe 2 ), atau bahkan keduanya. Insulin dibuat dalam pankreas, organ yang terletak di belakang perut. Pankreas mengandung kelompok sel beta yang membuat insulin dan melepaskannya ke dalam darah. Jika sel-sel beta pankreas tidak memproduksi insulin yang cukup, ataupun tubuh tidak merespon insulin yang ada, glukosa menumpuk dalam darah bukan diserap oleh sel-sel dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi, sehingga menyebabkan diabetes. Pada saat itu sel-sel tubuh akan kekurangan energi meskipun kadar glukosa darah tinggi. Jadi akar permasalahan diabetes melitus tipe 1 ada pada pankreas yang tidak dapat melakukan tugasnya, yaitu memproduksi zat insulin dalam jumlah yang dibutuhkan. Sedangkan pada diabetes melitus tipe 2 diakibatkan karena sel-sel tubuh yang tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dengan efektif walaupun jumlahnya cukup ( resistensi insulin ), maka kadar gula darah pun menjadi tidak terkontrol. Inilah yang akhirnya menyebabkan terjadinya penyakit diabetes melitus. Jadi jika ada obat diabetes yang mampu memperbaiki fungsi pankreas dan sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh, pastinya tidak ada penyakit diabetes yang tidak bisa disembuhkan.   Gejala Diabetes Melitus  Deteksi dini dan pengobatan diabetes yang tepat dapat menurunkan risiko terkena komplikasi diabetes.  Berikut ini adalah gejala diabetes yang khas;  = Sering buang air kecil, terjadi karena ginjal ingin membersihkan kelebihan glukosa di dalam darah. ( kemampuan bertahan organ tubuh manusia ) = Sering haus karena banyaknya cairan yang keluar dari air seni tadi. = Merasa sangat lapar meskipun Anda makan seperti biasa = Pandangan kabur = Kehilangan banyak berat badan karena glukosa tidak dapat diproses oleh tubuh untuk menjadi energi, maka tubuh mulai memecah otot dan cadangan lemak untuk menghasilkan energi. (diabetes tipe 1) = Mudah lelah karena tubuh sudah tidak dapat memproses glukosa menjadi energi. Kesemutan, nyeri, atau mati rasa di tangan / kaki (diabetes tipe 2) Bila Anda mengalami gejala-gejala yang disebutkan diatas, ada baiknya Anda memeriksakan kadar gula darah Anda secepatnya, sehingga bisa diobati sesegera mungkin.   WASPADAI KOMPLIKASI EFEK DIABETES  Seiring waktu, Penyakit diabetes ini kalau diabaikan begitu saja Aneka macam komplikasi dan menimbulkan dampak selanjutnya seperti :  = Hipertesi dan Stroke = Sulit Tidur, Gugup dan Depresi = Lebih cepat terkena serangan jantung = Gagal Ginjal = Luka sulit sembuh sehingga tidak sedikit yang ujung sampai Amputasi = Sering kesemutan, mati rasa = Kulit terasa kering dan mudah terkena luka = Infeksi penyakit mulut dan gigi = Penglihatan Mata Kabur, bisa menjadi katarak bahkan sampai kebutaan. = Masalah kehamilan = Kerusakan saraf dan pembuluh darah  Penyakit gagal ginjal merupakan salah satu komplikasi yang menakutkan akibat penyakit diabetes melitus yang tidak diobati dengan baik. Diabetes menyumbang 25 persen dari penyebab gagal ginjal kronik menurut dr.Dharmeizar, Sp.PD, Ketua Perhimpunan Nefrologi Indonesia. Karena kadar gula darah yang tidak terkontrol pada pasien diabetes akan memicu kerusakan glomerulus (pembuluh darah halus tempat penyaringan darah di ginjal). Ketika kerusakan glomerulus dibiarkan terus maka akan menyebabkan ginjal kehilangan kemampuan untuk menyaring darah sehingga terjadilah penyakit gagal ginjal. DR Sirwono Waspadji juga mengatakan bahwa para pasien diabetes melitus harus bersiap-siap menghadapi risiko pembekuan darah, pada pembuluh darah baik yang ada di otak maupun jantung, yang pada akhirnya akan mengganggu peredaran darah ke fungsi-fungsi penting jaringan tubuh, seperti jantung dan otak. Inilah sebabnya mengapa penderita diabetes juga rentan terhadap komplikasi stroke dan penyakit jantung. Anda tentu tidak ingin mengalami komplikasi penyakit menakutkan ini kan? Oleh karenanya segera tangani diabetes melitus Anda dan tetap jaga kadar gula darah Anda di ambang batas normal. Caranya dengan mengatur pola makan serta berolahraga secara teratur, serta dengan menggunakan obat-obatan herbal untuk diabetes melitus.  Kenapa Harus Dengan Obat Herbal?  Karena hingga saat ini belum ada obat diabetes melitus paling ampuh dari dunia kedokteran yang bisa mengobati diabetes melitus hingga tuntas. Artinya pasien diabetes melitus harus terus menerus mengkonsumsi obat dokter atau suntik insulin sepanjang hidupnya. Ini bukan jalan keluar terbaik karena obat-obatan kimia yang dikonsumsi dalam jangka waktu lama bisa menyebabkan kerusakan organ tubuh seperti hati dan ginjal. Penggunaan insulin memang bisa membantu pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 1, namun pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 2 pemberian insulin menjadi percuma karena sel-sel tubuh tetap tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dalam proses metabolisme glukosa. Sedangkan obat herbal bisa mengobati diabetes melitus dan menjaga kadar gula darah di ambang normal dengan cara menyehatkan kembali organ pankreas dan memperbaiki sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh Anda. Jika pankreas sudah kembali sehat maka otomatis dapat menjalankan fungsinya dengan baik yakni untuk menghasilkan insulin dalam jumlah cukup. Begitu juga dengan sel-sel tubuh Anda akan kembali merespon setiap insulin di dalam tubuh untuk digunakan secara efektif, sehingga kadar gula darah dapat senantiasa normal.  Mungkin anda sudah tahu betapa perlunya penanganan penderita diabetes. Baik diabetes tipe satu (Diabetes kering) maupun penderita diabetes tipe dua (Diabetes basah). Gejala untuk dapat mencegah komplikasi yang bisa terjadi diendalikan salah satu tujuannya merupakani untuk menormalkan kadar gula darah biar seimbang dan.

Di dalam artikel ini akan diulas apa penyebab, gejala dan obat herbal diabetes melitus yang ampuh untuk mengatasi masalah penyakit Anda. Diabetes Melitus atau kencing manis secara umum diartikan dengan meningkatnya kadar gula dalam darah. Orang yang mengidap penyakit diabetes memiliki kadar glukosa dalam darah yang tinggi, yang juga disebut gula darah tinggi atau hiperglikemia. Diabetes ialah suatu jenis penyakit kronis yang secara perlahan akan mematikan pengidapnya jika tidak diatasi dan diberikan pengobatan yang tepat dan cepat. Orang yang menderita penyakit diabetes mesti selalu menerapkan gaya hidup sehat seperti berolahraga secara teratur, mengkonsumsi makanan sehat, tidak mengkonsumsi makanan yang mengandung banyak gula, menjaga kebersihan tubuh dan lingkungan serta mengkonsumsi obat herbal diabetes melitus yang tepat. Tindakan seperti ini amat dibutuhkan buat mencegah dan meminimalisir munculnya bahaya dan komplikasi penyakit diabetes.   Penyebab Diabetes Melitus  Banyak ahli medis maupun herbalis yang mengatakan bahwa penyakit diabetes melitus tidak dapat disembuhkan, hanya dapat dijaga kadar gulanya agar selalu dalam ambang batas normal. Apakah benar demikian? Untuk mengetahui jawabannya kita harus tahu akar permasalahan dari penyakit ini. Diabetes adalah akibat dari gangguan metabolisme di dalam tubuh. Tubuh manusia akan mencerna makanan yang masuk ke dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi.     LAYANAN KONSULTASI DAN PEMESANAN WA : 081 903 555 115    Caranya dengan memecah karbohidrat dan gula untuk dijadikan glukosa. Dengan bantuan hormon insulin, sel-sel di seluruh tubuh lalu menyerap glukosa dan menggunakannya untuk energi. Diabetes terjadi ketika tubuh tidak membuat cukup insulin ( diabetes tipe 1 ) atau tidak dapat menggunakan insulin secara efektif / resistensi insulin ( diabetes tipe 2 ), atau bahkan keduanya. Insulin dibuat dalam pankreas, organ yang terletak di belakang perut. Pankreas mengandung kelompok sel beta yang membuat insulin dan melepaskannya ke dalam darah. Jika sel-sel beta pankreas tidak memproduksi insulin yang cukup, ataupun tubuh tidak merespon insulin yang ada, glukosa menumpuk dalam darah bukan diserap oleh sel-sel dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi, sehingga menyebabkan diabetes. Pada saat itu sel-sel tubuh akan kekurangan energi meskipun kadar glukosa darah tinggi. Jadi akar permasalahan diabetes melitus tipe 1 ada pada pankreas yang tidak dapat melakukan tugasnya, yaitu memproduksi zat insulin dalam jumlah yang dibutuhkan. Sedangkan pada diabetes melitus tipe 2 diakibatkan karena sel-sel tubuh yang tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dengan efektif walaupun jumlahnya cukup ( resistensi insulin ), maka kadar gula darah pun menjadi tidak terkontrol. Inilah yang akhirnya menyebabkan terjadinya penyakit diabetes melitus. Jadi jika ada obat diabetes yang mampu memperbaiki fungsi pankreas dan sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh, pastinya tidak ada penyakit diabetes yang tidak bisa disembuhkan.   Gejala Diabetes Melitus  Deteksi dini dan pengobatan diabetes yang tepat dapat menurunkan risiko terkena komplikasi diabetes.  Berikut ini adalah gejala diabetes yang khas;  = Sering buang air kecil, terjadi karena ginjal ingin membersihkan kelebihan glukosa di dalam darah. ( kemampuan bertahan organ tubuh manusia ) = Sering haus karena banyaknya cairan yang keluar dari air seni tadi. = Merasa sangat lapar meskipun Anda makan seperti biasa = Pandangan kabur = Kehilangan banyak berat badan karena glukosa tidak dapat diproses oleh tubuh untuk menjadi energi, maka tubuh mulai memecah otot dan cadangan lemak untuk menghasilkan energi. (diabetes tipe 1) = Mudah lelah karena tubuh sudah tidak dapat memproses glukosa menjadi energi. Kesemutan, nyeri, atau mati rasa di tangan / kaki (diabetes tipe 2) Bila Anda mengalami gejala-gejala yang disebutkan diatas, ada baiknya Anda memeriksakan kadar gula darah Anda secepatnya, sehingga bisa diobati sesegera mungkin.   WASPADAI KOMPLIKASI EFEK DIABETES  Seiring waktu, Penyakit diabetes ini kalau diabaikan begitu saja Aneka macam komplikasi dan menimbulkan dampak selanjutnya seperti :  = Hipertesi dan Stroke = Sulit Tidur, Gugup dan Depresi = Lebih cepat terkena serangan jantung = Gagal Ginjal = Luka sulit sembuh sehingga tidak sedikit yang ujung sampai Amputasi = Sering kesemutan, mati rasa = Kulit terasa kering dan mudah terkena luka = Infeksi penyakit mulut dan gigi = Penglihatan Mata Kabur, bisa menjadi katarak bahkan sampai kebutaan. = Masalah kehamilan = Kerusakan saraf dan pembuluh darah  Penyakit gagal ginjal merupakan salah satu komplikasi yang menakutkan akibat penyakit diabetes melitus yang tidak diobati dengan baik. Diabetes menyumbang 25 persen dari penyebab gagal ginjal kronik menurut dr.Dharmeizar, Sp.PD, Ketua Perhimpunan Nefrologi Indonesia. Karena kadar gula darah yang tidak terkontrol pada pasien diabetes akan memicu kerusakan glomerulus (pembuluh darah halus tempat penyaringan darah di ginjal). Ketika kerusakan glomerulus dibiarkan terus maka akan menyebabkan ginjal kehilangan kemampuan untuk menyaring darah sehingga terjadilah penyakit gagal ginjal. DR Sirwono Waspadji juga mengatakan bahwa para pasien diabetes melitus harus bersiap-siap menghadapi risiko pembekuan darah, pada pembuluh darah baik yang ada di otak maupun jantung, yang pada akhirnya akan mengganggu peredaran darah ke fungsi-fungsi penting jaringan tubuh, seperti jantung dan otak. Inilah sebabnya mengapa penderita diabetes juga rentan terhadap komplikasi stroke dan penyakit jantung. Anda tentu tidak ingin mengalami komplikasi penyakit menakutkan ini kan? Oleh karenanya segera tangani diabetes melitus Anda dan tetap jaga kadar gula darah Anda di ambang batas normal. Caranya dengan mengatur pola makan serta berolahraga secara teratur, serta dengan menggunakan obat-obatan herbal untuk diabetes melitus.  Kenapa Harus Dengan Obat Herbal?  Karena hingga saat ini belum ada obat diabetes melitus paling ampuh dari dunia kedokteran yang bisa mengobati diabetes melitus hingga tuntas. Artinya pasien diabetes melitus harus terus menerus mengkonsumsi obat dokter atau suntik insulin sepanjang hidupnya. Ini bukan jalan keluar terbaik karena obat-obatan kimia yang dikonsumsi dalam jangka waktu lama bisa menyebabkan kerusakan organ tubuh seperti hati dan ginjal. Penggunaan insulin memang bisa membantu pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 1, namun pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 2 pemberian insulin menjadi percuma karena sel-sel tubuh tetap tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dalam proses metabolisme glukosa. Sedangkan obat herbal bisa mengobati diabetes melitus dan menjaga kadar gula darah di ambang normal dengan cara menyehatkan kembali organ pankreas dan memperbaiki sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh Anda. Jika pankreas sudah kembali sehat maka otomatis dapat menjalankan fungsinya dengan baik yakni untuk menghasilkan insulin dalam jumlah cukup. Begitu juga dengan sel-sel tubuh Anda akan kembali merespon setiap insulin di dalam tubuh untuk digunakan secara efektif, sehingga kadar gula darah dapat senantiasa normal.  Mungkin anda sudah tahu betapa perlunya penanganan penderita diabetes. Baik diabetes tipe satu (Diabetes kering) maupun penderita diabetes tipe dua (Diabetes basah).

Jika sel-sel beta pankreas tidak memproduksi insulin yang cukup, ataupun tubuh tidak merespon insulin yang ada, glukosa menumpuk dalam darah bukan diserap oleh sel-sel dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi, sehingga menyebabkan diabetes. Pada saat itu sel-sel tubuh akan kekurangan energi meskipun kadar glukosa darah tinggi. Jadi akar permasalahan diabetes melitus tipe 1 ada pada pankreas yang tidak dapat melakukan tugasnya, yaitu memproduksi zat insulin dalam jumlah yang dibutuhkan. Sedangkan pada diabetes melitus tipe 2 diakibatkan karena sel-sel tubuh yang tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dengan efektif walaupun jumlahnya cukup ( resistensi insulin ), maka kadar gula darah pun menjadi tidak terkontrol. Inilah yang akhirnya menyebabkan terjadinya penyakit diabetes melitus. Jadi jika ada obat diabetes yang mampu memperbaiki fungsi pankreas dan sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh, pastinya tidak ada penyakit diabetes yang tidak bisa disembuhkan.   Gejala Diabetes Melitus  Deteksi dini dan pengobatan diabetes yang tepat dapat menurunkan risiko terkena komplikasi diabetes.  Berikut ini adalah gejala diabetes yang khas;  = Sering buang air kecil, terjadi karena ginjal ingin membersihkan kelebihan glukosa di dalam darah. ( kemampuan bertahan organ tubuh manusia ) = Sering haus karena banyaknya cairan yang keluar dari air seni tadi. = Merasa sangat lapar meskipun Anda makan seperti biasa = Pandangan kabur = Kehilangan banyak berat badan karena glukosa tidak dapat diproses oleh tubuh untuk menjadi energi, maka tubuh mulai memecah otot dan cadangan lemak untuk menghasilkan energi. (diabetes tipe 1) = Mudah lelah karena tubuh sudah tidak dapat memproses glukosa menjadi energi. Kesemutan, nyeri, atau mati rasa di tangan / kaki (diabetes tipe 2) Bila Anda mengalami gejala-gejala yang disebutkan diatas, ada baiknya Anda memeriksakan kadar gula darah Anda secepatnya, sehingga bisa diobati sesegera mungkin.   WASPADAI KOMPLIKASI EFEK DIABETES  Seiring waktu, Penyakit diabetes ini kalau diabaikan begitu saja Aneka macam komplikasi dan menimbulkan dampak selanjutnya seperti :  = Hipertesi dan Stroke = Sulit Tidur, Gugup dan Depresi = Lebih cepat terkena serangan jantung = Gagal Ginjal = Luka sulit sembuh sehingga tidak sedikit yang ujung sampai Amputasi = Sering kesemutan, mati rasa = Kulit terasa kering dan mudah terkena luka = Infeksi penyakit mulut dan gigi = Penglihatan Mata Kabur, bisa menjadi katarak bahkan sampai kebutaan. = Masalah kehamilan = Kerusakan saraf dan pembuluh darah  Penyakit gagal ginjal merupakan salah satu komplikasi yang menakutkan akibat penyakit diabetes melitus yang tidak diobati dengan baik. Diabetes menyumbang 25 persen dari penyebab gagal ginjal kronik menurut dr.Dharmeizar, Sp.PD, Ketua Perhimpunan Nefrologi Indonesia. Karena kadar gula darah yang tidak terkontrol pada pasien diabetes akan memicu kerusakan glomerulus (pembuluh darah halus tempat penyaringan darah di ginjal). Ketika kerusakan glomerulus dibiarkan terus maka akan menyebabkan ginjal kehilangan kemampuan untuk menyaring darah sehingga terjadilah penyakit gagal ginjal. DR Sirwono Waspadji juga mengatakan bahwa para pasien diabetes melitus harus bersiap-siap menghadapi risiko pembekuan darah, pada pembuluh darah baik yang ada di otak maupun jantung, yang pada akhirnya akan mengganggu peredaran darah ke fungsi-fungsi penting jaringan tubuh, seperti jantung dan otak. Inilah sebabnya mengapa penderita diabetes juga rentan terhadap komplikasi stroke dan penyakit jantung. Anda tentu tidak ingin mengalami komplikasi penyakit menakutkan ini kan? Oleh karenanya segera tangani diabetes melitus Anda dan tetap jaga kadar gula darah Anda di ambang batas normal. Caranya dengan mengatur pola makan serta berolahraga secara teratur, serta dengan menggunakan obat-obatan herbal untuk diabetes melitus.  Kenapa Harus Dengan Obat Herbal?  Karena hingga saat ini belum ada obat diabetes melitus paling ampuh dari dunia kedokteran yang bisa mengobati diabetes melitus hingga tuntas. Artinya pasien diabetes melitus harus terus menerus mengkonsumsi obat dokter atau suntik insulin sepanjang hidupnya. Ini bukan jalan keluar terbaik karena obat-obatan kimia yang dikonsumsi dalam jangka waktu lama bisa menyebabkan kerusakan organ tubuh seperti hati dan ginjal. Penggunaan insulin memang bisa membantu pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 1, namun pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 2 pemberian insulin menjadi percuma karena sel-sel tubuh tetap tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dalam proses metabolisme glukosa. Sedangkan obat herbal bisa mengobati diabetes melitus dan menjaga kadar gula darah di ambang normal dengan cara menyehatkan kembali organ pankreas dan memperbaiki sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh Anda. Jika pankreas sudah kembali sehat maka otomatis dapat menjalankan fungsinya dengan baik yakni untuk menghasilkan insulin dalam jumlah cukup. Begitu juga dengan sel-sel tubuh Anda akan kembali merespon setiap insulin di dalam tubuh untuk digunakan secara efektif, sehingga kadar gula darah dapat senantiasa normal.  Mungkin anda sudah tahu betapa perlunya penanganan penderita diabetes. Baik diabetes tipe satu (Diabetes kering) maupun penderita diabetes tipe dua (Diabetes basah).

Diabetes Melitus atau kencing manis secara umum diartikan dengan meningkatnya kadar gula dalam darah. Orang yang mengidap penyakit diabetes memiliki kadar glukosa dalam darah yang tinggi, yang juga disebut gula darah tinggi atau hiperglikemia. Diabetes ialah suatu jenis penyakit kronis yang secara perlahan akan mematikan pengidapnya jika tidak diatasi dan diberikan pengobatan yang tepat dan cepat.

Tindakan seperti ini amat dibutuhkan buat mencegah dan meminimalisir munculnya bahaya dan komplikasi penyakit diabetes.   Penyebab Diabetes Melitus  Banyak ahli medis maupun herbalis yang mengatakan bahwa penyakit diabetes melitus tidak dapat disembuhkan, hanya dapat dijaga kadar gulanya agar selalu dalam ambang batas normal.

Di dalam artikel ini akan diulas apa penyebab, gejala dan obat herbal diabetes melitus yang ampuh untuk mengatasi masalah penyakit Anda. Diabetes Melitus atau kencing manis secara umum diartikan dengan meningkatnya kadar gula dalam darah. Orang yang mengidap penyakit diabetes memiliki kadar glukosa dalam darah yang tinggi, yang juga disebut gula darah tinggi atau hiperglikemia. Diabetes ialah suatu jenis penyakit kronis yang secara perlahan akan mematikan pengidapnya jika tidak diatasi dan diberikan pengobatan yang tepat dan cepat. Orang yang menderita penyakit diabetes mesti selalu menerapkan gaya hidup sehat seperti berolahraga secara teratur, mengkonsumsi makanan sehat, tidak mengkonsumsi makanan yang mengandung banyak gula, menjaga kebersihan tubuh dan lingkungan serta mengkonsumsi obat herbal diabetes melitus yang tepat. Tindakan seperti ini amat dibutuhkan buat mencegah dan meminimalisir munculnya bahaya dan komplikasi penyakit diabetes.   Penyebab Diabetes Melitus  Banyak ahli medis maupun herbalis yang mengatakan bahwa penyakit diabetes melitus tidak dapat disembuhkan, hanya dapat dijaga kadar gulanya agar selalu dalam ambang batas normal. Apakah benar demikian? Untuk mengetahui jawabannya kita harus tahu akar permasalahan dari penyakit ini. Diabetes adalah akibat dari gangguan metabolisme di dalam tubuh. Tubuh manusia akan mencerna makanan yang masuk ke dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi.     LAYANAN KONSULTASI DAN PEMESANAN WA : 081 903 555 115    Caranya dengan memecah karbohidrat dan gula untuk dijadikan glukosa. Dengan bantuan hormon insulin, sel-sel di seluruh tubuh lalu menyerap glukosa dan menggunakannya untuk energi. Diabetes terjadi ketika tubuh tidak membuat cukup insulin ( diabetes tipe 1 ) atau tidak dapat menggunakan insulin secara efektif / resistensi insulin ( diabetes tipe 2 ), atau bahkan keduanya. Insulin dibuat dalam pankreas, organ yang terletak di belakang perut. Pankreas mengandung kelompok sel beta yang membuat insulin dan melepaskannya ke dalam darah. Jika sel-sel beta pankreas tidak memproduksi insulin yang cukup, ataupun tubuh tidak merespon insulin yang ada, glukosa menumpuk dalam darah bukan diserap oleh sel-sel dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi, sehingga menyebabkan diabetes. Pada saat itu sel-sel tubuh akan kekurangan energi meskipun kadar glukosa darah tinggi. Jadi akar permasalahan diabetes melitus tipe 1 ada pada pankreas yang tidak dapat melakukan tugasnya, yaitu memproduksi zat insulin dalam jumlah yang dibutuhkan. Sedangkan pada diabetes melitus tipe 2 diakibatkan karena sel-sel tubuh yang tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dengan efektif walaupun jumlahnya cukup ( resistensi insulin ), maka kadar gula darah pun menjadi tidak terkontrol. Inilah yang akhirnya menyebabkan terjadinya penyakit diabetes melitus. Jadi jika ada obat diabetes yang mampu memperbaiki fungsi pankreas dan sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh, pastinya tidak ada penyakit diabetes yang tidak bisa disembuhkan.   Gejala Diabetes Melitus  Deteksi dini dan pengobatan diabetes yang tepat dapat menurunkan risiko terkena komplikasi diabetes.  Berikut ini adalah gejala diabetes yang khas;  = Sering buang air kecil, terjadi karena ginjal ingin membersihkan kelebihan glukosa di dalam darah. ( kemampuan bertahan organ tubuh manusia ) = Sering haus karena banyaknya cairan yang keluar dari air seni tadi. = Merasa sangat lapar meskipun Anda makan seperti biasa = Pandangan kabur = Kehilangan banyak berat badan karena glukosa tidak dapat diproses oleh tubuh untuk menjadi energi, maka tubuh mulai memecah otot dan cadangan lemak untuk menghasilkan energi. (diabetes tipe 1) = Mudah lelah karena tubuh sudah tidak dapat memproses glukosa menjadi energi. Kesemutan, nyeri, atau mati rasa di tangan / kaki (diabetes tipe 2) Bila Anda mengalami gejala-gejala yang disebutkan diatas, ada baiknya Anda memeriksakan kadar gula darah Anda secepatnya, sehingga bisa diobati sesegera mungkin.   WASPADAI KOMPLIKASI EFEK DIABETES  Seiring waktu, Penyakit diabetes ini kalau diabaikan begitu saja Aneka macam komplikasi dan menimbulkan dampak selanjutnya seperti :  = Hipertesi dan Stroke = Sulit Tidur, Gugup dan Depresi = Lebih cepat terkena serangan jantung = Gagal Ginjal = Luka sulit sembuh sehingga tidak sedikit yang ujung sampai Amputasi = Sering kesemutan, mati rasa = Kulit terasa kering dan mudah terkena luka = Infeksi penyakit mulut dan gigi = Penglihatan Mata Kabur, bisa menjadi katarak bahkan sampai kebutaan. = Masalah kehamilan = Kerusakan saraf dan pembuluh darah  Penyakit gagal ginjal merupakan salah satu komplikasi yang menakutkan akibat penyakit diabetes melitus yang tidak diobati dengan baik. Diabetes menyumbang 25 persen dari penyebab gagal ginjal kronik menurut dr.Dharmeizar, Sp.PD, Ketua Perhimpunan Nefrologi Indonesia. Karena kadar gula darah yang tidak terkontrol pada pasien diabetes akan memicu kerusakan glomerulus (pembuluh darah halus tempat penyaringan darah di ginjal). Ketika kerusakan glomerulus dibiarkan terus maka akan menyebabkan ginjal kehilangan kemampuan untuk menyaring darah sehingga terjadilah penyakit gagal ginjal. DR Sirwono Waspadji juga mengatakan bahwa para pasien diabetes melitus harus bersiap-siap menghadapi risiko pembekuan darah, pada pembuluh darah baik yang ada di otak maupun jantung, yang pada akhirnya akan mengganggu peredaran darah ke fungsi-fungsi penting jaringan tubuh, seperti jantung dan otak. Inilah sebabnya mengapa penderita diabetes juga rentan terhadap komplikasi stroke dan penyakit jantung. Anda tentu tidak ingin mengalami komplikasi penyakit menakutkan ini kan? Oleh karenanya segera tangani diabetes melitus Anda dan tetap jaga kadar gula darah Anda di ambang batas normal. Caranya dengan mengatur pola makan serta berolahraga secara teratur, serta dengan menggunakan obat-obatan herbal untuk diabetes melitus.  Kenapa Harus Dengan Obat Herbal?  Karena hingga saat ini belum ada obat diabetes melitus paling ampuh dari dunia kedokteran yang bisa mengobati diabetes melitus hingga tuntas. Artinya pasien diabetes melitus harus terus menerus mengkonsumsi obat dokter atau suntik insulin sepanjang hidupnya. Ini bukan jalan keluar terbaik karena obat-obatan kimia yang dikonsumsi dalam jangka waktu lama bisa menyebabkan kerusakan organ tubuh seperti hati dan ginjal. Penggunaan insulin memang bisa membantu pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 1, namun pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 2 pemberian insulin menjadi percuma karena sel-sel tubuh tetap tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dalam proses metabolisme glukosa. Sedangkan obat herbal bisa mengobati diabetes melitus dan menjaga kadar gula darah di ambang normal dengan cara menyehatkan kembali organ pankreas dan memperbaiki sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh Anda. Jika pankreas sudah kembali sehat maka otomatis dapat menjalankan fungsinya dengan baik yakni untuk menghasilkan insulin dalam jumlah cukup.

Diabetes ialah suatu jenis penyakit kronis yang secara perlahan akan mematikan pengidapnya jika tidak diatasi dan diberikan pengobatan yang tepat dan cepat. Orang yang menderita penyakit diabetes mesti selalu menerapkan gaya hidup sehat seperti berolahraga secara teratur, mengkonsumsi makanan sehat, tidak mengkonsumsi makanan yang mengandung banyak gula, menjaga kebersihan tubuh dan lingkungan serta mengkonsumsi obat herbal diabetes melitus yang tepat. Tindakan seperti ini amat dibutuhkan buat mencegah dan meminimalisir munculnya bahaya dan komplikasi penyakit diabetes.   Penyebab Diabetes Melitus  Banyak ahli medis maupun herbalis yang mengatakan bahwa penyakit diabetes melitus tidak dapat disembuhkan, hanya dapat dijaga kadar gulanya agar selalu dalam ambang batas normal. Apakah benar demikian? Untuk mengetahui jawabannya kita harus tahu akar permasalahan dari penyakit ini. Diabetes adalah akibat dari gangguan metabolisme di dalam tubuh. Tubuh manusia akan mencerna makanan yang masuk ke dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi.     LAYANAN KONSULTASI DAN PEMESANAN WA : 081 903 555 115    Caranya dengan memecah karbohidrat dan gula untuk dijadikan glukosa. Dengan bantuan hormon insulin, sel-sel di seluruh tubuh lalu menyerap glukosa dan menggunakannya untuk energi. Diabetes terjadi ketika tubuh tidak membuat cukup insulin ( diabetes tipe 1 ) atau tidak dapat menggunakan insulin secara efektif / resistensi insulin ( diabetes tipe 2 ), atau bahkan keduanya. Insulin dibuat dalam pankreas, organ yang terletak di belakang perut. Pankreas mengandung kelompok sel beta yang membuat insulin dan melepaskannya ke dalam darah. Jika sel-sel beta pankreas tidak memproduksi insulin yang cukup, ataupun tubuh tidak merespon insulin yang ada, glukosa menumpuk dalam darah bukan diserap oleh sel-sel dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi, sehingga menyebabkan diabetes. Pada saat itu sel-sel tubuh akan kekurangan energi meskipun kadar glukosa darah tinggi. Jadi akar permasalahan diabetes melitus tipe 1 ada pada pankreas yang tidak dapat melakukan tugasnya, yaitu memproduksi zat insulin dalam jumlah yang dibutuhkan. Sedangkan pada diabetes melitus tipe 2 diakibatkan karena sel-sel tubuh yang tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dengan efektif walaupun jumlahnya cukup ( resistensi insulin ), maka kadar gula darah pun menjadi tidak terkontrol. Inilah yang akhirnya menyebabkan terjadinya penyakit diabetes melitus. Jadi jika ada obat diabetes yang mampu memperbaiki fungsi pankreas dan sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh, pastinya tidak ada penyakit diabetes yang tidak bisa disembuhkan.   Gejala Diabetes Melitus  Deteksi dini dan pengobatan diabetes yang tepat dapat menurunkan risiko terkena komplikasi diabetes.  Berikut ini adalah gejala diabetes yang khas;  = Sering buang air kecil, terjadi karena ginjal ingin membersihkan kelebihan glukosa di dalam darah. ( kemampuan bertahan organ tubuh manusia ) = Sering haus karena banyaknya cairan yang keluar dari air seni tadi. = Merasa sangat lapar meskipun Anda makan seperti biasa = Pandangan kabur = Kehilangan banyak berat badan karena glukosa tidak dapat diproses oleh tubuh untuk menjadi energi, maka tubuh mulai memecah otot dan cadangan lemak untuk menghasilkan energi. (diabetes tipe 1) = Mudah lelah karena tubuh sudah tidak dapat memproses glukosa menjadi energi. Kesemutan, nyeri, atau mati rasa di tangan / kaki (diabetes tipe 2) Bila Anda mengalami gejala-gejala yang disebutkan diatas, ada baiknya Anda memeriksakan kadar gula darah Anda secepatnya, sehingga bisa diobati sesegera mungkin.   WASPADAI KOMPLIKASI EFEK DIABETES  Seiring waktu, Penyakit diabetes ini kalau diabaikan begitu saja Aneka macam komplikasi dan menimbulkan dampak selanjutnya seperti :  = Hipertesi dan Stroke = Sulit Tidur, Gugup dan Depresi = Lebih cepat terkena serangan jantung = Gagal Ginjal = Luka sulit sembuh sehingga tidak sedikit yang ujung sampai Amputasi = Sering kesemutan, mati rasa = Kulit terasa kering dan mudah terkena luka = Infeksi penyakit mulut dan gigi = Penglihatan Mata Kabur, bisa menjadi katarak bahkan sampai kebutaan. = Masalah kehamilan = Kerusakan saraf dan pembuluh darah  Penyakit gagal ginjal merupakan salah satu komplikasi yang menakutkan akibat penyakit diabetes melitus yang tidak diobati dengan baik. Diabetes menyumbang 25 persen dari penyebab gagal ginjal kronik menurut dr.Dharmeizar, Sp.PD, Ketua Perhimpunan Nefrologi Indonesia. Karena kadar gula darah yang tidak terkontrol pada pasien diabetes akan memicu kerusakan glomerulus (pembuluh darah halus tempat penyaringan darah di ginjal). Ketika kerusakan glomerulus dibiarkan terus maka akan menyebabkan ginjal kehilangan kemampuan untuk menyaring darah sehingga terjadilah penyakit gagal ginjal. DR Sirwono Waspadji juga mengatakan bahwa para pasien diabetes melitus harus bersiap-siap menghadapi risiko pembekuan darah, pada pembuluh darah baik yang ada di otak maupun jantung, yang pada akhirnya akan mengganggu peredaran darah ke fungsi-fungsi penting jaringan tubuh, seperti jantung dan otak. Inilah sebabnya mengapa penderita diabetes juga rentan terhadap komplikasi stroke dan penyakit jantung. Anda tentu tidak ingin mengalami komplikasi penyakit menakutkan ini kan? Oleh karenanya segera tangani diabetes melitus Anda dan tetap jaga kadar gula darah Anda di ambang batas normal. Caranya dengan mengatur pola makan serta berolahraga secara teratur, serta dengan menggunakan obat-obatan herbal untuk diabetes melitus.  Kenapa Harus Dengan Obat Herbal?  Karena hingga saat ini belum ada obat diabetes melitus paling ampuh dari dunia kedokteran yang bisa mengobati diabetes melitus hingga tuntas. Artinya pasien diabetes melitus harus terus menerus mengkonsumsi obat dokter atau suntik insulin sepanjang hidupnya. Ini bukan jalan keluar terbaik karena obat-obatan kimia yang dikonsumsi dalam jangka waktu lama bisa menyebabkan kerusakan organ tubuh seperti hati dan ginjal. Penggunaan insulin memang bisa membantu pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 1, namun pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 2 pemberian insulin menjadi percuma karena sel-sel tubuh tetap tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dalam proses metabolisme glukosa. Sedangkan obat herbal bisa mengobati diabetes melitus dan menjaga kadar gula darah di ambang normal dengan cara menyehatkan kembali organ pankreas dan memperbaiki sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh Anda. Jika pankreas sudah kembali sehat maka otomatis dapat menjalankan fungsinya dengan baik yakni untuk menghasilkan insulin dalam jumlah cukup. Begitu juga dengan sel-sel tubuh Anda akan kembali merespon setiap insulin di dalam tubuh untuk digunakan secara efektif, sehingga kadar gula darah dapat senantiasa normal.  Mungkin anda sudah tahu betapa perlunya penanganan penderita diabetes. Baik diabetes tipe satu (Diabetes kering) maupun penderita diabetes tipe dua (Diabetes basah).

Di dalam artikel ini akan diulas apa penyebab, gejala dan obat herbal diabetes melitus yang ampuh untuk mengatasi masalah penyakit Anda. Diabetes Melitus atau kencing manis secara umum diartikan dengan meningkatnya kadar gula dalam darah. Orang yang mengidap penyakit diabetes memiliki kadar glukosa dalam darah yang tinggi, yang juga disebut gula darah tinggi atau hiperglikemia. Diabetes ialah suatu jenis penyakit kronis yang secara perlahan akan mematikan pengidapnya jika tidak diatasi dan diberikan pengobatan yang tepat dan cepat. Orang yang menderita penyakit diabetes mesti selalu menerapkan gaya hidup sehat seperti berolahraga secara teratur, mengkonsumsi makanan sehat, tidak mengkonsumsi makanan yang mengandung banyak gula, menjaga kebersihan tubuh dan lingkungan serta mengkonsumsi obat herbal diabetes melitus yang tepat. Tindakan seperti ini amat dibutuhkan buat mencegah dan meminimalisir munculnya bahaya dan komplikasi penyakit diabetes.   Penyebab Diabetes Melitus  Banyak ahli medis maupun herbalis yang mengatakan bahwa penyakit diabetes melitus tidak dapat disembuhkan, hanya dapat dijaga kadar gulanya agar selalu dalam ambang batas normal. Apakah benar demikian? Untuk mengetahui jawabannya kita harus tahu akar permasalahan dari penyakit ini. Diabetes adalah akibat dari gangguan metabolisme di dalam tubuh. Tubuh manusia akan mencerna makanan yang masuk ke dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi.     LAYANAN KONSULTASI DAN PEMESANAN WA : 081 903 555 115    Caranya dengan memecah karbohidrat dan gula untuk dijadikan glukosa. Dengan bantuan hormon insulin, sel-sel di seluruh tubuh lalu menyerap glukosa dan menggunakannya untuk energi. Diabetes terjadi ketika tubuh tidak membuat cukup insulin ( diabetes tipe 1 ) atau tidak dapat menggunakan insulin secara efektif / resistensi insulin ( diabetes tipe 2 ), atau bahkan keduanya. Insulin dibuat dalam pankreas, organ yang terletak di belakang perut. Pankreas mengandung kelompok sel beta yang membuat insulin dan melepaskannya ke dalam darah. Jika sel-sel beta pankreas tidak memproduksi insulin yang cukup, ataupun tubuh tidak merespon insulin yang ada, glukosa menumpuk dalam darah bukan diserap oleh sel-sel dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi, sehingga menyebabkan diabetes. Pada saat itu sel-sel tubuh akan kekurangan energi meskipun kadar glukosa darah tinggi. Jadi akar permasalahan diabetes melitus tipe 1 ada pada pankreas yang tidak dapat melakukan tugasnya, yaitu memproduksi zat insulin dalam jumlah yang dibutuhkan. Sedangkan pada diabetes melitus tipe 2 diakibatkan karena sel-sel tubuh yang tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dengan efektif walaupun jumlahnya cukup ( resistensi insulin ), maka kadar gula darah pun menjadi tidak terkontrol. Inilah yang akhirnya menyebabkan terjadinya penyakit diabetes melitus. Jadi jika ada obat diabetes yang mampu memperbaiki fungsi pankreas dan sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh, pastinya tidak ada penyakit diabetes yang tidak bisa disembuhkan.   Gejala Diabetes Melitus  Deteksi dini dan pengobatan diabetes yang tepat dapat menurunkan risiko terkena komplikasi diabetes.  Berikut ini adalah gejala diabetes yang khas;  = Sering buang air kecil, terjadi karena ginjal ingin membersihkan kelebihan glukosa di dalam darah. ( kemampuan bertahan organ tubuh manusia ) = Sering haus karena banyaknya cairan yang keluar dari air seni tadi. = Merasa sangat lapar meskipun Anda makan seperti biasa = Pandangan kabur = Kehilangan banyak berat badan karena glukosa tidak dapat diproses oleh tubuh untuk menjadi energi, maka tubuh mulai memecah otot dan cadangan lemak untuk menghasilkan energi. (diabetes tipe 1) = Mudah lelah karena tubuh sudah tidak dapat memproses glukosa menjadi energi. Kesemutan, nyeri, atau mati rasa di tangan / kaki (diabetes tipe 2) Bila Anda mengalami gejala-gejala yang disebutkan diatas, ada baiknya Anda memeriksakan kadar gula darah Anda secepatnya, sehingga bisa diobati sesegera mungkin.   WASPADAI KOMPLIKASI EFEK DIABETES  Seiring waktu, Penyakit diabetes ini kalau diabaikan begitu saja Aneka macam komplikasi dan menimbulkan dampak selanjutnya seperti :  = Hipertesi dan Stroke = Sulit Tidur, Gugup dan Depresi = Lebih cepat terkena serangan jantung = Gagal Ginjal = Luka sulit sembuh sehingga tidak sedikit yang ujung sampai Amputasi = Sering kesemutan, mati rasa = Kulit terasa kering dan mudah terkena luka = Infeksi penyakit mulut dan gigi = Penglihatan Mata Kabur, bisa menjadi katarak bahkan sampai kebutaan. = Masalah kehamilan = Kerusakan saraf dan pembuluh darah  Penyakit gagal ginjal merupakan salah satu komplikasi yang menakutkan akibat penyakit diabetes melitus yang tidak diobati dengan baik. Diabetes menyumbang 25 persen dari penyebab gagal ginjal kronik menurut dr.Dharmeizar, Sp.PD, Ketua Perhimpunan Nefrologi Indonesia. Karena kadar gula darah yang tidak terkontrol pada pasien diabetes akan memicu kerusakan glomerulus (pembuluh darah halus tempat penyaringan darah di ginjal). Ketika kerusakan glomerulus dibiarkan terus maka akan menyebabkan ginjal kehilangan kemampuan untuk menyaring darah sehingga terjadilah penyakit gagal ginjal. DR Sirwono Waspadji juga mengatakan bahwa para pasien diabetes melitus harus bersiap-siap menghadapi risiko pembekuan darah, pada pembuluh darah baik yang ada di otak maupun jantung, yang pada akhirnya akan mengganggu peredaran darah ke fungsi-fungsi penting jaringan tubuh, seperti jantung dan otak. Inilah sebabnya mengapa penderita diabetes juga rentan terhadap komplikasi stroke dan penyakit jantung. Anda tentu tidak ingin mengalami komplikasi penyakit menakutkan ini kan? Oleh karenanya segera tangani diabetes melitus Anda dan tetap jaga kadar gula darah Anda di ambang batas normal. Caranya dengan mengatur pola makan serta berolahraga secara teratur, serta dengan menggunakan obat-obatan herbal untuk diabetes melitus.  Kenapa Harus Dengan Obat Herbal?  Karena hingga saat ini belum ada obat diabetes melitus paling ampuh dari dunia kedokteran yang bisa mengobati diabetes melitus hingga tuntas. Artinya pasien diabetes melitus harus terus menerus mengkonsumsi obat dokter atau suntik insulin sepanjang hidupnya. Ini bukan jalan keluar terbaik karena obat-obatan kimia yang dikonsumsi dalam jangka waktu lama bisa menyebabkan kerusakan organ tubuh seperti hati dan ginjal. Penggunaan insulin memang bisa membantu pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 1, namun pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 2 pemberian insulin menjadi percuma karena sel-sel tubuh tetap tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dalam proses metabolisme glukosa. Sedangkan obat herbal bisa mengobati diabetes melitus dan menjaga kadar gula darah di ambang normal dengan cara menyehatkan kembali organ pankreas dan memperbaiki sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh Anda. Jika pankreas sudah kembali sehat maka otomatis dapat menjalankan fungsinya dengan baik yakni untuk menghasilkan insulin dalam jumlah cukup. Begitu juga dengan sel-sel tubuh Anda akan kembali merespon setiap insulin di dalam tubuh untuk digunakan secara efektif, sehingga kadar gula darah dapat senantiasa normal.

Insulin dibuat dalam pankreas, organ yang terletak di belakang perut. Pankreas mengandung kelompok sel beta yang membuat insulin dan melepaskannya ke dalam darah. Jika sel-sel beta pankreas tidak memproduksi insulin yang cukup, ataupun tubuh tidak merespon insulin yang ada, glukosa menumpuk dalam darah bukan diserap oleh sel-sel dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi, sehingga menyebabkan diabetes. Pada saat itu sel-sel tubuh akan kekurangan energi meskipun kadar glukosa darah tinggi. Jadi akar permasalahan diabetes melitus tipe 1 ada pada pankreas yang tidak dapat melakukan tugasnya, yaitu memproduksi zat insulin dalam jumlah yang dibutuhkan. Sedangkan pada diabetes melitus tipe 2 diakibatkan karena sel-sel tubuh yang tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dengan efektif walaupun jumlahnya cukup ( resistensi insulin ), maka kadar gula darah pun menjadi tidak terkontrol. Inilah yang akhirnya menyebabkan terjadinya penyakit diabetes melitus. Jadi jika ada obat diabetes yang mampu memperbaiki fungsi pankreas dan sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh, pastinya tidak ada penyakit diabetes yang tidak bisa disembuhkan.   Gejala Diabetes Melitus  Deteksi dini dan pengobatan diabetes yang tepat dapat menurunkan risiko terkena komplikasi diabetes.  Berikut ini adalah gejala diabetes yang khas;  = Sering buang air kecil, terjadi karena ginjal ingin membersihkan kelebihan glukosa di dalam darah. ( kemampuan bertahan organ tubuh manusia ) = Sering haus karena banyaknya cairan yang keluar dari air seni tadi. = Merasa sangat lapar meskipun Anda makan seperti biasa = Pandangan kabur = Kehilangan banyak berat badan karena glukosa tidak dapat diproses oleh tubuh untuk menjadi energi, maka tubuh mulai memecah otot dan cadangan lemak untuk menghasilkan energi. (diabetes tipe 1) = Mudah lelah karena tubuh sudah tidak dapat memproses glukosa menjadi energi. Kesemutan, nyeri, atau mati rasa di tangan / kaki (diabetes tipe 2) Bila Anda mengalami gejala-gejala yang disebutkan diatas, ada baiknya Anda memeriksakan kadar gula darah Anda secepatnya, sehingga bisa diobati sesegera mungkin.   WASPADAI KOMPLIKASI EFEK DIABETES  Seiring waktu, Penyakit diabetes ini kalau diabaikan begitu saja Aneka macam komplikasi dan menimbulkan dampak selanjutnya seperti :  = Hipertesi dan Stroke = Sulit Tidur, Gugup dan Depresi = Lebih cepat terkena serangan jantung = Gagal Ginjal = Luka sulit sembuh sehingga tidak sedikit yang ujung sampai Amputasi = Sering kesemutan, mati rasa = Kulit terasa kering dan mudah terkena luka = Infeksi penyakit mulut dan gigi = Penglihatan Mata Kabur, bisa menjadi katarak bahkan sampai kebutaan. = Masalah kehamilan = Kerusakan saraf dan pembuluh darah  Penyakit gagal ginjal merupakan salah satu komplikasi yang menakutkan akibat penyakit diabetes melitus yang tidak diobati dengan baik. Diabetes menyumbang 25 persen dari penyebab gagal ginjal kronik menurut dr.Dharmeizar, Sp.PD, Ketua Perhimpunan Nefrologi Indonesia. Karena kadar gula darah yang tidak terkontrol pada pasien diabetes akan memicu kerusakan glomerulus (pembuluh darah halus tempat penyaringan darah di ginjal). Ketika kerusakan glomerulus dibiarkan terus maka akan menyebabkan ginjal kehilangan kemampuan untuk menyaring darah sehingga terjadilah penyakit gagal ginjal. DR Sirwono Waspadji juga mengatakan bahwa para pasien diabetes melitus harus bersiap-siap menghadapi risiko pembekuan darah, pada pembuluh darah baik yang ada di otak maupun jantung, yang pada akhirnya akan mengganggu peredaran darah ke fungsi-fungsi penting jaringan tubuh, seperti jantung dan otak. Inilah sebabnya mengapa penderita diabetes juga rentan terhadap komplikasi stroke dan penyakit jantung. Anda tentu tidak ingin mengalami komplikasi penyakit menakutkan ini kan? Oleh karenanya segera tangani diabetes melitus Anda dan tetap jaga kadar gula darah Anda di ambang batas normal. Caranya dengan mengatur pola makan serta berolahraga secara teratur, serta dengan menggunakan obat-obatan herbal untuk diabetes melitus.  Kenapa Harus Dengan Obat Herbal?  Karena hingga saat ini belum ada obat diabetes melitus paling ampuh dari dunia kedokteran yang bisa mengobati diabetes melitus hingga tuntas. Artinya pasien diabetes melitus harus terus menerus mengkonsumsi obat dokter atau suntik insulin sepanjang hidupnya. Ini bukan jalan keluar terbaik karena obat-obatan kimia yang dikonsumsi dalam jangka waktu lama bisa menyebabkan kerusakan organ tubuh seperti hati dan ginjal. Penggunaan insulin memang bisa membantu pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 1, namun pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 2 pemberian insulin menjadi percuma karena sel-sel tubuh tetap tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dalam proses metabolisme glukosa. Sedangkan obat herbal bisa mengobati diabetes melitus dan menjaga kadar gula darah di ambang normal dengan cara menyehatkan kembali organ pankreas dan memperbaiki sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh Anda. Jika pankreas sudah kembali sehat maka otomatis dapat menjalankan fungsinya dengan baik yakni untuk menghasilkan insulin dalam jumlah cukup. Begitu juga dengan sel-sel tubuh Anda akan kembali merespon setiap insulin di dalam tubuh untuk digunakan secara efektif, sehingga kadar gula darah dapat senantiasa normal.  Mungkin anda sudah tahu betapa perlunya penanganan penderita diabetes. Baik diabetes tipe satu (Diabetes kering) maupun penderita diabetes tipe dua (Diabetes basah). Gejala untuk dapat mencegah komplikasi yang bisa terjadi diendalikan salah satu tujuannya merupakani untuk menormalkan kadar gula darah biar seimbang dan.

Di dalam artikel ini akan diulas apa penyebab, gejala dan obat herbal diabetes melitus yang ampuh untuk mengatasi masalah penyakit Anda. Diabetes Melitus atau kencing manis secara umum diartikan dengan meningkatnya kadar gula dalam darah. Orang yang mengidap penyakit diabetes memiliki kadar glukosa dalam darah yang tinggi, yang juga disebut gula darah tinggi atau hiperglikemia. Diabetes ialah suatu jenis penyakit kronis yang secara perlahan akan mematikan pengidapnya jika tidak diatasi dan diberikan pengobatan yang tepat dan cepat. Orang yang menderita penyakit diabetes mesti selalu menerapkan gaya hidup sehat seperti berolahraga secara teratur, mengkonsumsi makanan sehat, tidak mengkonsumsi makanan yang mengandung banyak gula, menjaga kebersihan tubuh dan lingkungan serta mengkonsumsi obat herbal diabetes melitus yang tepat. Tindakan seperti ini amat dibutuhkan buat mencegah dan meminimalisir munculnya bahaya dan komplikasi penyakit diabetes.   Penyebab Diabetes Melitus  Banyak ahli medis maupun herbalis yang mengatakan bahwa penyakit diabetes melitus tidak dapat disembuhkan, hanya dapat dijaga kadar gulanya agar selalu dalam ambang batas normal. Apakah benar demikian? Untuk mengetahui jawabannya kita harus tahu akar permasalahan dari penyakit ini. Diabetes adalah akibat dari gangguan metabolisme di dalam tubuh.

Di dalam artikel ini akan diulas apa penyebab, gejala dan obat herbal diabetes melitus yang ampuh untuk mengatasi masalah penyakit Anda. Diabetes Melitus atau kencing manis secara umum diartikan dengan meningkatnya kadar gula dalam darah. Orang yang mengidap penyakit diabetes memiliki kadar glukosa dalam darah yang tinggi, yang juga disebut gula darah tinggi atau hiperglikemia. Diabetes ialah suatu jenis penyakit kronis yang secara perlahan akan mematikan pengidapnya jika tidak diatasi dan diberikan pengobatan yang tepat dan cepat. Orang yang menderita penyakit diabetes mesti selalu menerapkan gaya hidup sehat seperti berolahraga secara teratur, mengkonsumsi makanan sehat, tidak mengkonsumsi makanan yang mengandung banyak gula, menjaga kebersihan tubuh dan lingkungan serta mengkonsumsi obat herbal diabetes melitus yang tepat. Tindakan seperti ini amat dibutuhkan buat mencegah dan meminimalisir munculnya bahaya dan komplikasi penyakit diabetes.   Penyebab Diabetes Melitus  Banyak ahli medis maupun herbalis yang mengatakan bahwa penyakit diabetes melitus tidak dapat disembuhkan, hanya dapat dijaga kadar gulanya agar selalu dalam ambang batas normal. Apakah benar demikian? Untuk mengetahui jawabannya kita harus tahu akar permasalahan dari penyakit ini. Diabetes adalah akibat dari gangguan metabolisme di dalam tubuh. Tubuh manusia akan mencerna makanan yang masuk ke dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi.     LAYANAN KONSULTASI DAN PEMESANAN WA : 081 903 555 115    Caranya dengan memecah karbohidrat dan gula untuk dijadikan glukosa. Dengan bantuan hormon insulin, sel-sel di seluruh tubuh lalu menyerap glukosa dan menggunakannya untuk energi. Diabetes terjadi ketika tubuh tidak membuat cukup insulin ( diabetes tipe 1 ) atau tidak dapat menggunakan insulin secara efektif / resistensi insulin ( diabetes tipe 2 ), atau bahkan keduanya. Insulin dibuat dalam pankreas, organ yang terletak di belakang perut. Pankreas mengandung kelompok sel beta yang membuat insulin dan melepaskannya ke dalam darah. Jika sel-sel beta pankreas tidak memproduksi insulin yang cukup, ataupun tubuh tidak merespon insulin yang ada, glukosa menumpuk dalam darah bukan diserap oleh sel-sel dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi, sehingga menyebabkan diabetes. Pada saat itu sel-sel tubuh akan kekurangan energi meskipun kadar glukosa darah tinggi. Jadi akar permasalahan diabetes melitus tipe 1 ada pada pankreas yang tidak dapat melakukan tugasnya, yaitu memproduksi zat insulin dalam jumlah yang dibutuhkan. Sedangkan pada diabetes melitus tipe 2 diakibatkan karena sel-sel tubuh yang tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dengan efektif walaupun jumlahnya cukup ( resistensi insulin ), maka kadar gula darah pun menjadi tidak terkontrol. Inilah yang akhirnya menyebabkan terjadinya penyakit diabetes melitus. Jadi jika ada obat diabetes yang mampu memperbaiki fungsi pankreas dan sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh, pastinya tidak ada penyakit diabetes yang tidak bisa disembuhkan.   Gejala Diabetes Melitus  Deteksi dini dan pengobatan diabetes yang tepat dapat menurunkan risiko terkena komplikasi diabetes.  Berikut ini adalah gejala diabetes yang khas;  = Sering buang air kecil, terjadi karena ginjal ingin membersihkan kelebihan glukosa di dalam darah. ( kemampuan bertahan organ tubuh manusia ) = Sering haus karena banyaknya cairan yang keluar dari air seni tadi. = Merasa sangat lapar meskipun Anda makan seperti biasa = Pandangan kabur = Kehilangan banyak berat badan karena glukosa tidak dapat diproses oleh tubuh untuk menjadi energi, maka tubuh mulai memecah otot dan cadangan lemak untuk menghasilkan energi. (diabetes tipe 1) = Mudah lelah karena tubuh sudah tidak dapat memproses glukosa menjadi energi. Kesemutan, nyeri, atau mati rasa di tangan / kaki (diabetes tipe 2) Bila Anda mengalami gejala-gejala yang disebutkan diatas, ada baiknya Anda memeriksakan kadar gula darah Anda secepatnya, sehingga bisa diobati sesegera mungkin.   WASPADAI KOMPLIKASI EFEK DIABETES  Seiring waktu, Penyakit diabetes ini kalau diabaikan begitu saja Aneka macam komplikasi dan menimbulkan dampak selanjutnya seperti :  = Hipertesi dan Stroke = Sulit Tidur, Gugup dan Depresi = Lebih cepat terkena serangan jantung = Gagal Ginjal = Luka sulit sembuh sehingga tidak sedikit yang ujung sampai Amputasi = Sering kesemutan, mati rasa = Kulit terasa kering dan mudah terkena luka = Infeksi penyakit mulut dan gigi = Penglihatan Mata Kabur, bisa menjadi katarak bahkan sampai kebutaan. = Masalah kehamilan = Kerusakan saraf dan pembuluh darah  Penyakit gagal ginjal merupakan salah satu komplikasi yang menakutkan akibat penyakit diabetes melitus yang tidak diobati dengan baik. Diabetes menyumbang 25 persen dari penyebab gagal ginjal kronik menurut dr.Dharmeizar, Sp.PD, Ketua Perhimpunan Nefrologi Indonesia. Karena kadar gula darah yang tidak terkontrol pada pasien diabetes akan memicu kerusakan glomerulus (pembuluh darah halus tempat penyaringan darah di ginjal). Ketika kerusakan glomerulus dibiarkan terus maka akan menyebabkan ginjal kehilangan kemampuan untuk menyaring darah sehingga terjadilah penyakit gagal ginjal. DR Sirwono Waspadji juga mengatakan bahwa para pasien diabetes melitus harus bersiap-siap menghadapi risiko pembekuan darah, pada pembuluh darah baik yang ada di otak maupun jantung, yang pada akhirnya akan mengganggu peredaran darah ke fungsi-fungsi penting jaringan tubuh, seperti jantung dan otak. Inilah sebabnya mengapa penderita diabetes juga rentan terhadap komplikasi stroke dan penyakit jantung. Anda tentu tidak ingin mengalami komplikasi penyakit menakutkan ini kan? Oleh karenanya segera tangani diabetes melitus Anda dan tetap jaga kadar gula darah Anda di ambang batas normal. Caranya dengan mengatur pola makan serta berolahraga secara teratur, serta dengan menggunakan obat-obatan herbal untuk diabetes melitus.  Kenapa Harus Dengan Obat Herbal?  Karena hingga saat ini belum ada obat diabetes melitus paling ampuh dari dunia kedokteran yang bisa mengobati diabetes melitus hingga tuntas. Artinya pasien diabetes melitus harus terus menerus mengkonsumsi obat dokter atau suntik insulin sepanjang hidupnya. Ini bukan jalan keluar terbaik karena obat-obatan kimia yang dikonsumsi dalam jangka waktu lama bisa menyebabkan kerusakan organ tubuh seperti hati dan ginjal. Penggunaan insulin memang bisa membantu pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 1, namun pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 2 pemberian insulin menjadi percuma karena sel-sel tubuh tetap tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dalam proses metabolisme glukosa.

Orang yang mengidap penyakit diabetes memiliki kadar glukosa dalam darah yang tinggi, yang juga disebut gula darah tinggi atau hiperglikemia. Diabetes ialah suatu jenis penyakit kronis yang secara perlahan akan mematikan pengidapnya jika tidak diatasi dan diberikan pengobatan yang tepat dan cepat. Orang yang menderita penyakit diabetes mesti selalu menerapkan gaya hidup sehat seperti berolahraga secara teratur, mengkonsumsi makanan sehat, tidak mengkonsumsi makanan yang mengandung banyak gula, menjaga kebersihan tubuh dan lingkungan serta mengkonsumsi obat herbal diabetes melitus yang tepat. Tindakan seperti ini amat dibutuhkan buat mencegah dan meminimalisir munculnya bahaya dan komplikasi penyakit diabetes.   Penyebab Diabetes Melitus  Banyak ahli medis maupun herbalis yang mengatakan bahwa penyakit diabetes melitus tidak dapat disembuhkan, hanya dapat dijaga kadar gulanya agar selalu dalam ambang batas normal. Apakah benar demikian? Untuk mengetahui jawabannya kita harus tahu akar permasalahan dari penyakit ini. Diabetes adalah akibat dari gangguan metabolisme di dalam tubuh. Tubuh manusia akan mencerna makanan yang masuk ke dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi.

Dengan bantuan hormon insulin, sel-sel di seluruh tubuh lalu menyerap glukosa dan menggunakannya untuk energi. Diabetes terjadi ketika tubuh tidak membuat cukup insulin ( diabetes tipe 1 ) atau tidak dapat menggunakan insulin secara efektif / resistensi insulin ( diabetes tipe 2 ), atau bahkan keduanya. Insulin dibuat dalam pankreas, organ yang terletak di belakang perut. Pankreas mengandung kelompok sel beta yang membuat insulin dan melepaskannya ke dalam darah. Jika sel-sel beta pankreas tidak memproduksi insulin yang cukup, ataupun tubuh tidak merespon insulin yang ada, glukosa menumpuk dalam darah bukan diserap oleh sel-sel dalam tubuh untuk dijadikan energi, sehingga menyebabkan diabetes. Pada saat itu sel-sel tubuh akan kekurangan energi meskipun kadar glukosa darah tinggi. Jadi akar permasalahan diabetes melitus tipe 1 ada pada pankreas yang tidak dapat melakukan tugasnya, yaitu memproduksi zat insulin dalam jumlah yang dibutuhkan. Sedangkan pada diabetes melitus tipe 2 diakibatkan karena sel-sel tubuh yang tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dengan efektif walaupun jumlahnya cukup ( resistensi insulin ), maka kadar gula darah pun menjadi tidak terkontrol. Inilah yang akhirnya menyebabkan terjadinya penyakit diabetes melitus. Jadi jika ada obat diabetes yang mampu memperbaiki fungsi pankreas dan sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh, pastinya tidak ada penyakit diabetes yang tidak bisa disembuhkan.   Gejala Diabetes Melitus  Deteksi dini dan pengobatan diabetes yang tepat dapat menurunkan risiko terkena komplikasi diabetes.  Berikut ini adalah gejala diabetes yang khas;  = Sering buang air kecil, terjadi karena ginjal ingin membersihkan kelebihan glukosa di dalam darah. ( kemampuan bertahan organ tubuh manusia ) = Sering haus karena banyaknya cairan yang keluar dari air seni tadi. = Merasa sangat lapar meskipun Anda makan seperti biasa = Pandangan kabur = Kehilangan banyak berat badan karena glukosa tidak dapat diproses oleh tubuh untuk menjadi energi, maka tubuh mulai memecah otot dan cadangan lemak untuk menghasilkan energi. (diabetes tipe 1) = Mudah lelah karena tubuh sudah tidak dapat memproses glukosa menjadi energi. Kesemutan, nyeri, atau mati rasa di tangan / kaki (diabetes tipe 2) Bila Anda mengalami gejala-gejala yang disebutkan diatas, ada baiknya Anda memeriksakan kadar gula darah Anda secepatnya, sehingga bisa diobati sesegera mungkin.   WASPADAI KOMPLIKASI EFEK DIABETES  Seiring waktu, Penyakit diabetes ini kalau diabaikan begitu saja Aneka macam komplikasi dan menimbulkan dampak selanjutnya seperti :  = Hipertesi dan Stroke = Sulit Tidur, Gugup dan Depresi = Lebih cepat terkena serangan jantung = Gagal Ginjal = Luka sulit sembuh sehingga tidak sedikit yang ujung sampai Amputasi = Sering kesemutan, mati rasa = Kulit terasa kering dan mudah terkena luka = Infeksi penyakit mulut dan gigi = Penglihatan Mata Kabur, bisa menjadi katarak bahkan sampai kebutaan. = Masalah kehamilan = Kerusakan saraf dan pembuluh darah  Penyakit gagal ginjal merupakan salah satu komplikasi yang menakutkan akibat penyakit diabetes melitus yang tidak diobati dengan baik. Diabetes menyumbang 25 persen dari penyebab gagal ginjal kronik menurut dr.Dharmeizar, Sp.PD, Ketua Perhimpunan Nefrologi Indonesia. Karena kadar gula darah yang tidak terkontrol pada pasien diabetes akan memicu kerusakan glomerulus (pembuluh darah halus tempat penyaringan darah di ginjal). Ketika kerusakan glomerulus dibiarkan terus maka akan menyebabkan ginjal kehilangan kemampuan untuk menyaring darah sehingga terjadilah penyakit gagal ginjal. DR Sirwono Waspadji juga mengatakan bahwa para pasien diabetes melitus harus bersiap-siap menghadapi risiko pembekuan darah, pada pembuluh darah baik yang ada di otak maupun jantung, yang pada akhirnya akan mengganggu peredaran darah ke fungsi-fungsi penting jaringan tubuh, seperti jantung dan otak. Inilah sebabnya mengapa penderita diabetes juga rentan terhadap komplikasi stroke dan penyakit jantung. Anda tentu tidak ingin mengalami komplikasi penyakit menakutkan ini kan? Oleh karenanya segera tangani diabetes melitus Anda dan tetap jaga kadar gula darah Anda di ambang batas normal. Caranya dengan mengatur pola makan serta berolahraga secara teratur, serta dengan menggunakan obat-obatan herbal untuk diabetes melitus.  Kenapa Harus Dengan Obat Herbal?  Karena hingga saat ini belum ada obat diabetes melitus paling ampuh dari dunia kedokteran yang bisa mengobati diabetes melitus hingga tuntas. Artinya pasien diabetes melitus harus terus menerus mengkonsumsi obat dokter atau suntik insulin sepanjang hidupnya. Ini bukan jalan keluar terbaik karena obat-obatan kimia yang dikonsumsi dalam jangka waktu lama bisa menyebabkan kerusakan organ tubuh seperti hati dan ginjal. Penggunaan insulin memang bisa membantu pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 1, namun pada pasien diabetes melitus tipe 2 pemberian insulin menjadi percuma karena sel-sel tubuh tetap tidak dapat menggunakan insulin dalam proses metabolisme glukosa. Sedangkan obat herbal bisa mengobati diabetes melitus dan menjaga kadar gula darah di ambang normal dengan cara menyehatkan kembali organ pankreas dan memperbaiki sensitifitas sel-sel tubuh Anda. Jika pankreas sudah kembali sehat maka otomatis dapat menjalankan fungsinya dengan baik yakni untuk menghasilkan insulin dalam jumlah cukup. Begitu juga dengan sel-sel tubuh Anda akan kembali merespon setiap insulin di dalam tubuh untuk digunakan secara efektif, sehingga kadar gula darah dapat senantiasa normal.  Mungkin anda sudah tahu betapa perlunya penanganan penderita diabetes. Baik diabetes tipe satu (Diabetes kering) maupun penderita diabetes tipe dua (Diabetes basah).
