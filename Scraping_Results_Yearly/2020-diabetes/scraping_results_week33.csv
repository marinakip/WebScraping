With that in mind,\na neural network would receive only the blood glucose values from a Continuous Glucose Monitor(CGM - a sensor that shows blood\nglucose values for the patient) and show in the output the next values for 30 minutes, preventing the patient from having\nto deal with unexpected hipo or hyperglycemia.\nWhy LSTM?\nLSTM is a certain type of recurrent neural network that will work really well with time series problems. Most of the recurrent\nneural networks deal with the problem of long term dependency problem. With the ""forget gate layer"", this neural network is\nable to keep long term data that still important.\nDatasets\nThe datasets used in this project were generated from UVA/Pandova Type 1 diabetes simulator implemented in Python that you\ncan check here.\nThere were used 4 adolescent patients:\n\nPatients 7 and 8 were patients without a good blood glucose time in range.\nPatient 8 was the one used to train the model\nPatient 1 was a patient with good blood glucose time in range.\nPatient 10 was a patient with a medium blood glucose time in range.\n\n\nTraining and testing\nYou can check the model training in the BG_Predictions.ipynb file. The code has a lot of comments for your deep understanding.\nThe model is set to receive 20 data points in the past and predict 6 points in the future. Considering the delta between each CGM signal equal to 5 minutes,\nthe model is using 100 minutes before to predict 30 minutes ahead. Long carbs usually take around 90 minutes to be ingested and most of the insulins have their peak at 60-90 minutes. With that in mind, the 20 last points were used to predict the next 6.\nAfter training the model with part of patient\'s 8 data, the resulting model was applied to the rest of the patient 8 data:\nPatient 08 Test Results - RSME: 15,10\n\nWith the model validated, it was applied to the next three patients:\nPatient 01 Results - RSME: 5,15\n\nPatient 10 Results - RSME: 5,82\n\nPatient 07 Results - RSME: 15,6\n\nIn the end, the model performed really well. The RSME( Root-Square-Mean Error) was the error variable used to evaluate the model\'s results.\nBaselines Comparisons\nSeeking for a deeper validation, the Baseline_Comparisons.ipynb file shows the application of other predictions\nmodels for the same patients. After running all patient\'s data for each model, the LSTM model finished with the best performance against all\nothers, as you can see in the table below.\n\nProject Development\nThe development of this project was part of a technical initiation research.\n\nStudent - Gabriel Monteiro - @gabriellm1\n\nTutor - Rafael Corsi @rafaelcorsi\n\nComputer Engineering \nInsper 2019-2020\nSão Paulo, Brazil\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/gabriellm1', 'info_list': ['10', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Dec 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', 'Kotlin', 'Updated Nov 2, 2020', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 20, 2020', '9', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Aug 14, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 10, 2021', 'Updated Aug 18, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 17, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['1', '          follower'], ['0', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '125 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/DavidsJulio', 'info_list': ['10', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Dec 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', 'Kotlin', 'Updated Nov 2, 2020', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 20, 2020', '9', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Aug 14, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 10, 2021', 'Updated Aug 18, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 17, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['10', '          followers'], ['0', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '106 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Diabetes-Milletus-Prediction\nDiabetes mellitus is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. It may cause many complications. According to the growing morbidity in recent years, in 2040, the world’s diabetic patients will reach 642 million, which means that one of the ten adults in the future is suffering from diabetes. There is no doubt that this alarming figure needs great attention. With the rapid development of machine learning, machine learning has been applied to many aspects of medical health for accurate predictions.\nSolution:\nThe aim of the project is to build a machine learning model that can efficiently discover the rules to predict the risk level of patients based on the given parameter about their health (In this project, we can use decision tree, random forest and neural network to predict diabetes mellitus). Then we evaluate the performance of the model in terms of different parameter like classification accuracy AUC-ROC Curves.\nAn android application is built from where the patient health features are entered and depending on the entered parameters, the machine learning model integrated to application will predict the type of diabetes and according to the type of diabetes diet plan for the person will be displayed on the UI\nDirectory contains\nDemonstration video link:   https://youtu.be/DmqHtUS_uaw\nContents\nIntroduction\nTheoritical analysis\nExperimental investigations\nData Preprocessing\nModel building\nFlowchart\nApplication\nConclusion\nSource code with output-python.\nFlask files\nHTML file\nDocumentaion  \n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/SmartPracticeschool', 'info_list': ['10', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Dec 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', 'Kotlin', 'Updated Nov 2, 2020', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 20, 2020', '9', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Aug 14, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 10, 2021', 'Updated Aug 18, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 17, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '11 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['PIMA-DIABETES\nPredicting the diabetes\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/ramchanderpaloju99', 'info_list': ['10', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Dec 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', 'Kotlin', 'Updated Nov 2, 2020', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 20, 2020', '9', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Apache-2.0 license', 'Updated Aug 14, 2020', 'Java', 'Updated Jan 10, 2021', 'Updated Aug 18, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 17, 2020']}"

In the United States, the estimated number of people over 18 years of age with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes is 30.2 million. The figure represents between 27.9 and 32.7 percent of the population.\n\n\nWithout ongoing, careful management, diabetes can lead to a buildup of sugars in the blood, which can increase the risk of dangerous complications, including stroke and heart disease.\n\n\nDifferent kinds of diabetes can occur, and managing the condition depends on the type. Not all forms of diabetes stem from a person being overweight or leading an inactive lifestyle. In fact, some are present from childhood.\n\n\nOur task is to predict whether a person is suffering from diabetes or not (Binary Classification)\n\n\n\n📦 Data Overview\nIn this problem you are given a Diabetes Data set consisting of following features -\n[\'Pregnancies\', \'Glucose\', \'BloodPressure\', \'SkinThickness\', \'Insulin\', \'BMI\', \'DiabetesPedigreeFunction\', \'Age\', \'Outcome\']\n\n✅  Requirements\nProgramming Language\n\nPackages\nAnaconda\nTools/IDE\nJupyter notebook (IPython)\nHow to use it\n\nFork this repository to have your own copy\nClone your copy on your local system\nInstall necessary packages\n\n\n📚 Reference\nImage(""https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-causes.html"")\n\n📜 License\nThis software is licensed under the MIT\nMIT © RitikGajjar3\n\n🤝 Contact\nEmail Id: ritik.gajjar.3@gmail.com\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritik-gajjar/\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/RitikGajjar3', 'info_list': ['Updated Aug 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Aug 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Sep 5, 2020', 'Updated Aug 14, 2020', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', '1', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Aug 16, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 11, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'Mumbai', 'stats_list': [['2', '          followers'], ['2', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '25 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/nimishajadhav', 'info_list': ['Updated Aug 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Aug 12, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 15, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Sep 5, 2020', 'Updated Aug 14, 2020', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', '1', 'JavaScript', 'Updated Aug 16, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 11, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 12, 2020']}","{'location': 'Boulder, CO', 'stats_list': [['1', '          follower'], ['2', '          following'], ['3']], 'contributions': '151 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': [""Pima Indians Diabetes Project\nThe point of this project is to determine if someone has diabetes based on data given from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict  whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\nThe dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.\nProject Overview\nIn this project, I:\n\nCreated a model with 85% accuracy that predicts if a patient has diabetes based on various health measures to help doctors focus on certain patients.\nUsed matplotolib & seaborn to visualize the data and understand it better.\nEngineered features from the data to quantify the value certain health factors such as BMI have on a patient's diagnosis.\nOptimized Gradient Boost Classifier using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.\nProductionized the model by pickling it into an object that can used in the future.\n\nCode and Resources Used\nPython Version: 3.8\nPackages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, pickle, xgboost\nData Cleaning\nAfter downloading the data from Kaggle, I took a look at it and saw that there were some missing values. These values came in the form of zeros. For example, nobody can have a BMI value of 0. To avoid this issue, I:\n\nDropped rows with a missing glucose value\nImputed missing insulin values using the median of the insulin column\nImputed missing blood pressurve values using the median of the blood pressure column\nImputed missing BMI values using the median of the BMI column\nScaled the dataset to standardize the independent features present in the data and prevent machine learning algorithms from weighing greater values higher and consider smaller values as the lower values\n\nModel Building\nI split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%.\nTesting Phase\nI decided to use this project as a time to test out as many classification models as I could so that I would be able to learn how each one worked. At this time, I did not scale my data, so some of these models might not be as accurate as they could have been. During this testing phase, I used the following models:\n\nLogisticRegression\nRidgeClassifier\nBaggingClassifier\nGaussianNB\nLinearSVC\nDecisionTreeClassifier\nRandomForestClassifier\nKNeighborsClassifier\nSVC\nXGBClassifier\n\nI used a for loop to gather the accuracy of each model, which probably was not the best idea. Next time, it would make more sense to have a pipeline for each model and run that. To evaluate each model, I decided to use a classification report so that I could see how many predictions are True and how many are False. More specifically, True Positives, False Positives, True negatives and False Negatives. After completing this project, I see that the function of these models are quite similar  and yield interchangeable results.\nThe top performers of this phase were LinearSVC, LogisticRegression, and the RidgeClassifier. They all had an accuracy of 0.69. Each of these models work in a very similar fashion, which helps me understand why all three models had identical f1-scores. These f1-sores were very hit or miss. All of the models had an f1-score of 0.82 for outcomes of '0', but for the outcome '1', their scores were stuck at 0.\nReal Model Building\nAfter this testing phase, I thought that I had gained enough knowledge through research to improve my model selection and development.\nI selected four models:\n\nRandom Forest Classifier\nXGBoost Classifier\nKNN Classifier\nGradient Boost Classifier\n\nI chose these models because they all had enough variation in their functionality that I thought would be useful due to their evaluation methods for this classification problem. The Random Forest Classifier is, well, random. XGBoost uses a number of nifty tricks like computing second-order gradients, i.e. second partial derivatives of the loss function (similar to Newton’s method). The KNN Classifier finds the distances between a query and all the examples in the data, selecting the specified number examples (K) closest to the query, then votes for the most frequent label. And finally, the Gradient Boost Classifier uses the loss function of the base model (e.g. random forest) as a proxy for minimizing the error of the overall model.\nModel performance\nThe Random Forest model far outperformed the other approaches on the test and validation sets.\n\nRandom Forest Classifier : 0.771\nXGBoostClassifier: 0.78\nKNeighborsClassifier: 0.77\nGradientBoostingClassifier: 0.85\n\nThe GradientBoostingClassifier far outperformed the other approaches on the test and validation sets.\nProductionization\nIn this step, I pickled my model and saved it into a callable object that can be used on other datasets.\nCode & resources Used\nEDA:\nhttps://github.com/KriAga/Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Dataset-Classification/blob/master/Final.ipynb\nhttps://github.com/KriAga/Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Dataset-Classification/blob/master/EDA%20Diabetes.ipynb\nData\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database\nModels\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/omkarsabnis/diabetes-prediction-using-ml-pima-dataset\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-train-and-compare-machine-learning-models-with-few-lines-of-code-b1d5e1e266dd\nhttps://github.com/krishnaik06/Diabetes-Prediction/blob/master/Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb\nAcknowledgements\nSmith, J.W., Everhart, J.E., Dickson, W.C., Knowler, W.C., & Johannes, R.S.

Also, NIH claims that diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death. U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, a government organization reports 15 million women in the United States have diabetes. Therefore, this project aims to awake our awareness of diabetes and help detect whether a patient has diabetes or not.\nThe dataset that is chosen is originally from the ‘National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases’, Maryland, US and is named as ‘Pima Indians Diabetes Database’. The dataset consists of eight medical predictor variables and one target variable, ‘Outcome’. The predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI (Body Mass Index) level, insulin levels, age, blood pressure, glucose, skin thickness, and diabetes pedigree function.\nR, a statistical computing and graphics tool was used for building the BI model. At first, the dataset was explored to understand and develop a general idea for further analysis. Correlations were found among variables, for example, there was a negative relationship between pregnancies and skin thickness; also, the distribution of BMI is symmetric.\nThen, classification models were built using this dataset, including decision tree model and logistic regression model, to predict whether a given female patient, with certain diagnostic measurements, has diabetes or not. For the decision tree model, unusual number of zeroes weere addressed, 60% of records were sampled as training data sets and 40% of records as validation data sets, decision tree was plotted, and decision tree model was evaluated using confusion matrix and ROC. For logistic regression model, I data imputation was performed prior, training data sets and validation data sets were sampled similarly, the logistic regression model was built, odds ratios computed, and the logistic regression model was evaluated using confusion matrix and ROC.\nAfter running and evaluating both the models, it was concluded that decision tree model is better than logistic regression model in this project. Not only because decision tree model has a higher accuracy rate in confusion matrix and a higher area in ROC than logistic regression model has, but also because logistic regression model relies largely on the independent variables, if we include wrong independent variables, there is no predictive value for this model.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/itsmeshalini', 'info_list': ['R', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', 'R', 'Updated Sep 7, 2020', 'Updated Aug 11, 2020', 'Updated Aug 13, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Oct 12, 2020', 'Updated Aug 12, 2020', 'Updated Aug 11, 2020', 'Updated Aug 14, 2020', 'Updated Aug 10, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 11, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['1', '          follower'], ['1', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '73 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['classification-diabete_data\nDiabetes as one of the harmful diseases is important to be predicted and cure. And it is happened because of increasing sugar or glucose in the blood.\nThere is a survey that shows 382 million people in the world are suffering from diabetes. The rise in machine learning methods makes process data easier than before.\nNowadays, most of the studies are working to build a model that can predict diabetes in early stages with high accuracy.\nMachine learning algorithms and classification algorithms can help researches to design models to predict diseases.\nThe datasets include different variables (independent) and the outcome variable (dependent).\nIndependent variables are the number of pregnancies the patient has had, BMI, insulin level, age, glucose, skin thickness, etc.\nThe dataset can be uploaded from the data world or Kaggle, but the source of the dataset is the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\nIn this dataset, all patients are a woman and at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\nOne of the interesting variables is Diabetes Pedigree Function or Pedi that includes data of diabetes mellitus history of genetic relative’s patients.\nBased on observations it is not clear how to satisfy this function for predicting the onset of diabetes.\nDataset includes:\n1-The pregnancy and age variables are integers.\n2- The population is young, less than 50 years old.\n3-Some variables have a zero-value cause to be errors in the dataset.\nAs a whole, the dataset involved 768 patients, which is 268 cases were diagnosed with diabetes.\nOutcome is dependent binary variable (1
