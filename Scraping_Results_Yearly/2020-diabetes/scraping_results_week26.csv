Higher thickness leads to obesity and chances of diabetes increases.\n5)Insulin: 2-Hour Serum Insulin (mu U/ml) Normal Insulin Level 16-166 mIU/L Values above this range can be alarming.\n6)BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/ height in m2) Body Mass Index of 18.5 to 25 is within the normal range BMI between 25 and 30 then it falls within the overweight range. A BMI of 30 or over falls within the obese range.\n7)Diabetes Pedigree Function: It provides information about diabetes history in relatives and genetic relationship of those relatives with patients. Higher Pedigree Function means patient is more likely to have diabetes.\n8)Age (years)\n9)Outcome: Class Variable (0 or 1) where ‘0’ denotes patient is not having diabetes and ‘1’ denotes patient having diabetes The dependent variable is whether the patient is having diabetes or not\n\n\nData visualization is done by using\n1)Count plot\n2)Histogram\n3)Heatmap\n4)Boxplot\n\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/trupti1605', 'info_list': ['HTML', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Jun 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 28, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 24, 2020', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 24, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jul 7, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jul 14, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 25, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 28, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['0', '          followers'], ['0', '          following'], ['1']], 'contributions': '8 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/ChenYang-Huang', 'info_list': ['HTML', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Jun 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 28, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 24, 2020', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 24, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jul 7, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jul 14, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 25, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 28, 2020']}","{'location': 'San Jose, California', 'stats_list': [['1', '          follower'], ['0', '          following'], ['0']], 'contributions': '12 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': [""Patient-Selection_for_Diabetes_Drug_Testing\nContext: Its a project for exciting unicorn healthcare startup that has created a groundbreaking diabetes drug that is ready for Phase III clinical trial testing. It is a very unique and sensitive drug that requires administering and screening the drug over at least 5-7 days of time in the hospital with frequent monitoring/testing and patient medication adherence training with a mobile application. I have been provided a patient dataset from a client partner and are tasked with building a predictive model that can identify which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on. Target patients are people that are likely to be in the hospital for this duration of time and will not incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring.\nIn order to achieve the goal a regression model must be created that can predict the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and use this to select/filter patients for the study.\nExpected Hospitalization Time Regression Model: Utilizing a synthetic dataset(denormalized at the line level augmentation) built off of the UCI Diabetes readmission dataset, We will build a regression model that predicts the expected days of hospitalization time and then convert this to a binary prediction of whether to include or exclude that patient from the clinical trial.\nThis project will demonstrate the importance of building the right data representation at the encounter level, with appropriate filtering and preprocessing/feature engineering of key medical code sets. This project will also require us to analyze and interpret their model for biases across key demographic groups.\nDataset\nDue to healthcare PHI regulations (HIPAA, HITECH), there are limited number of publicly available datasets and some datasets require training and approval. So, for the purpose of this exercise, we are using a dataset from UC Irvine that has been modified for this course. Please note that it is limited in its representation of some key features such as diagnosis codes which are usually an unordered list in 835s/837s (the HL7 standard interchange formats used for claims and remits).\n\nhttps://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008\n\nGetting Started\nFollow the instructions in starter_code/main_project.ipynb and be sure to set up your Anaconda environment to ge\nDependencies\nUsing Anaconda consists of the following:\n\nInstall miniconda on your computer, by selecting the latest Python version for your operating system. If you already have conda or miniconda installed, you should be able to skip this step and move on to step 2.\nCreate and activate * a new conda environment.\n\n* Each time you wish to work on any exercises, activate your conda environment!\n1. Installation\nDownload the latest version of miniconda that matches your system.\n\n\n\n\nLinux\nMac\nWindows\n\n\n\n\n64-bit\n64-bit (bash installer)\n64-bit (bash installer)\n64-bit (exe installer)\n\n\n32-bit\n32-bit (bash installer)\n\n32-bit (exe installer)\n\n\n\nInstall miniconda on your machine. Detailed instructions:\n\nLinux: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#linux-miniconda-install\nMac: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#os-x-miniconda-install\nWindows: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#windows-miniconda-install\n\n2. Create and Activate the Environment\nFor Windows users, these following commands need to be executed from the Anaconda prompt as opposed to a Windows terminal window. For Mac, a normal terminal window will work.\nGit and version control\nThese instructions also assume you have git installed for working with Github from a terminal window, but if you do not, you can download that first with the command:\nconda install git\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about version control and using git from the command line, take a look at our free course: Version Control with Git.\nNow, we're ready to create our local environment!\n\nClone the repository, and navigate to the downloaded folder. This may take a minute or two to clone due to the included image data.\n\nhttps://github.com/garg-sparsh/Patient-Selection_for_Diabetes_Drug_Testing.git\n\n\n\nCreate (and activate) a new environment, named diabetes_drug_testing with Python 3.7. If prompted to proceed with the install (Proceed [y]/n) type y.\n\nLinux or Mac:\n\nconda create -n diabetes_drug_testing python=3.7\nsource activate diabetes_drug_testing\n\n\nWindows:\n\nconda create --name diabetes_drug_testing python=3.7\nactivate diabetes_drug_testing\n\nAt this point your command line should look something like: (diabetes_drug_testing) <User>:USER_DIR <user>$. The (diabetes_drug_testing) indicates that your environment has been activated, and you can proceed with further package installations.\n\n\nInstall a few required pip packages, which are specified in the requirements text file. Be sure to run the command from the project root directory since the requirements.txt file is there. I also added a line for installing the environment in your notebook in case this is new for you. You should be able to now look for the environment when you select the kernel.\n\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\nipython3 kernel install --name diabetes_drug_testing --user\n\n\nLicense\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/garg-sparsh', 'info_list': ['HTML', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', 'HTML', 'Updated Jun 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 28, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 24, 2020', 'Updated Jun 26, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 24, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'MIT license', 'Updated Jul 7, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jul 14, 2020', 'Python', 'Updated Jun 25, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Jun 28, 2020']}"
