The CDC states that 122 million Americans have this chronic disease. In addition, the International Diabetes Federation(IDF) has found that 463 million individuals worldwide with a projected rise of up to 700 million people by 2045.\nEven though diabetes is a well-known health condition, there are still a lot of misconceptions. Many believe that diabetes is connected to obesity but many studies have proven that it’s not the case! Also, diabetes type 1 & 2 aren’t the only types that you could get.\nBecause of this, early detection is key which is why we decided to make a quick questionnaire for you as the first step to check if you have diabetes.We also want to provide you with additional information about diabetes so that you can stay informed about this growing chronic illness.\nTools and Programs\nPython, Tableau, Jupyter Notebook, Google Geocode API, MS Excel, MS PPT\nDatasets:\n\nDiabetes ML\nWHO World Figures\nTreatment Centers\nWikipedia\n\nETL\nAll the data and Jupyter notebooks used for this project can be found in the resources folder.\nDiabetes ML\nThe dataset from Frankfurt patients was validated for any unwanted records and stripped of any extra blank spaces while making sure there was enough data to process machine learning models.\n\n\nWHO World Figures\nThe CSV data file from the WHO website needed to be cleaned for spaces, commas and other hidden characters. The data was further enriched with missing ISO Country Codes and the Country Names. This was to allow for easy and better Tableau map visualizations. The data for countries in Europe had to be manually added from the WHO Country specific websites.\n\n\nTreatment Cleaning Notebook\nThis notebook contains the cleaning for the DRPR treatment centers CSV in preparation for Tableau. This CSV didn\'t contain the latitude and longitude needed to map out the treatment centers. The first step was importing the dependencies needed to make an API call with Google Geocode. After getting the data and adding the coordinates to the data frame, a new CSV was exported. The exported CSV was then used to clean up any missing coordinates, renaming and reorganizing columns to fit the Tableau hierarchy, editing NaNs for missing websites and second address lines, and splitting up the type of patients that the clinic provides care for. A new CSV was then exported to be used in Tableau.\n\n\nThe next section goes into the ETL and model testing for the best model to use for our website.\nMachine Learning\nFor the Machine Learning element of our project, we ran 3 different types of models.\nI.\tRandom Forest Classifier\nWe ran a Trees model or a Random Forest Classifier. This model gave us insight into the importance of the 8 features used to determine the risk of diabetes in individuals. As a reminder, the 8 features are ""Age"", ""Glucose"", ""DiabetesPedigreeFunction"", ""BloodPressure"", ""Insulin"", ""SkinThickness"", ""BMI"", and “Pregancies”.\nFrom these 8 features, we ran the Random Forest Classifier for 9 different combinations. We started with ""Age"",""Glucose"",""DiabetesPedigreeFunction"",""BloodPressure"",""Insulin"",""SkinThickness"",""BMI"". It returned a score of 0.956.\nHere is the feature importance for this combination.\n28.35% Glucose\n17.26% BMI\n16.37% Age\n13.57% DiabetesPedigreeFunction\n9.26% BloodPressure\n8.04% Insulin\n7.14% SkinThickness\nFor the next 5 combinations, we removed the feature with the lowest importance. Here are the results with their corresponding scores:\nScore: 0.958\n29.70% Glucose\n18.15% BMI\n17.47% Age\n14.95% DiabetesPedigreeFunction\n10.52% BloodPressure\n9.21% Insulin\nScore: 0.962\n32.42% Glucose\n20.90% BMI\n18.50% Age\n17.00% DiabetesPedigreeFunction\n11.17% BloodPressure\nScore: 0.966\n36.41% Glucose\n23.83% BMI\n20.12% Age\n19.64% DiabetesPedigreeFunction\nScore: 0.962\n42.23% Glucose\n32.72% BMI\n25.06% Age\nScore: 0.966\n52.23% Glucose\n47.77% BMI\nNext, we ran the classifier with only Glucose, and only with BMI. We chose Glucose because according to this model it always had the highest feature importance. We also ran BMI alone because it was always the second highest. BMI is easily known information for any individual since it is a simple calculation based on height and weight. The score for Glucose alone was 0.754 and the score for BMI alone was 0.742.\nLastly, we decided to run a model with Age and BMI. Again, our reasoning behind this decision is that this is readily known information for any individual. Here are the score and feature importance for this combination.\nScore: 0.924\n66.43% BMI\n33.57% Age\n II.\tDiabetes – Recognition Tester \nThe second machine learning model we ran was a Diabetes recognition tester that used sklearn to split the model into training and testing samples. Our dataset contained 2,000 records in total. The training sample contained 1,500 records and the testing sample contained 500 records. From that split we used sklearn to run logistic regression. This model was used to predict an outcome based on the different combinations of features. An outcome that returns a ‘0’ means the individual is predicted to have low diabetes risk. Conversely, an outcome that returns a ‘1’ means the individual is predicted to have high diabetes risk.\nWe ran the recognition model for 9 different combinations of features. When we included all the features, the model was able to predict the outcome correctly 78.8% of the time or 394 out of 500 records from the testing sample. Here are results from the 8 other combinations.\n76.6% ""Age"",""Glucose"",""DiabetesPedigreeFunction"",""BloodPressure"",""SkinThickness"",""BMI""\n383 out of 500 correct predictions\n76.6% ""Age"",""Glucose"",""DiabetesPedigreeFunction"",""SkinThickness"",""BMI""\n383 out of 500 correct predictions\n77.4% ""Age"",""Glucose"",""DiabetesPedigreeFunction"",""BMI""\n387 out of 500 correct predictions\n77.2% ""Age"",""Glucose"",""BMI""\n386 out of 500 correct predictions\n70.0% ""Age"",""BMI""\n350 out of 500 correct predictions\n76.4% ""Glucose"",""BMI""\n382 out of 500 correct predictions\n74.0% ""Glucose""\n370 out of 500 correct predictions\n69.2% ""BMI""\n346 out of 500 correct predictions\nWe decided to use the ‘complete’ model that contained all the features for the diabetes predictor on our website since it was able to predict the outcomes most accurately.\nIII.\tTensor Flow Model\nFinally, we also ran a Tensor Flow model that utilized several imports from sklearn and keras including train test split again, min max scaler, label encoder, sequential, and to_categorical among others. We split the data in training and testing, compiled the model, scaled the model, and fit the model.\nWe were able to obtain a model accuracy of 78.39% and the model loss was 43.95%. Using the tensor flow model, we obtained a diabetes risk score between 0 and 1 as opposed to only 0’s and 1’s. Our analytical capabilities were greatly increased from this output as shown by the scatter plots in our tableau analysis.\nHere are some insights that we can garner:\nThere were 99 test results with score less than 0.1 and 97 had an actual outcome of 0. Only 2.02% of individuals with a score less than 0.1 had an actual outcome of 1 which represents a high risk of diabetes.\nThere were 159 test results with score less than 0.2 and 153 had an actual outcome of 0. Only 3.77% of individuals with a score less than 0.2 had an actual outcome of 1.\nThere were 200 test results with score less than 0.3 and 185 had an actual outcome of 0. Only\n7.5% of individuals with a score less than 0.3 had an actual outcome of 1.\nThere were 236 test results with score less than 0.4 and 216 had an actual outcome of 0. Only 8.47% of individuals with a score less than 0.4 had an actual outcome of 1.\nThere were 281 test results with score less than 0.5 and 246 had an actual outcome of 0. Only 12.46% of individuals with a score less than 0.1 had an actual outcome of 1. As your score increases, the likelihood a high risk for diabetes increases, but even as the score approaches 0.5, the ratio is still only 12.46%.\nNext, we’ll take a look from the other perspective. \nThere were 59 test results with score greater than 0.9 and 51 had an actual outcome of 1. 86.44% of individuals with a score of more than 0.9 had an actual outcome of 1 which represents a high risk of diabetes. It’s safe to say that if your score is above 0.9, your risk of diabetes is very high.\nThere were 98 test results with scores greater than 0.8 and 77 had an actual outcome of 1. The percentage drops to 78.57%, which still means the probability of diabetes remains high/very high.\nFurthermore, there were 141 test results with a score greater than 0.7 and 100 had an actual outcome of 1 or 70.92% which still remains high.\nLastly, the results for over 0.6 and over 0.5 are 113/176 or 64.20% and 128/219 or 58.45%\n\nFindings/...what to find on the website??\nWorld Map 2000 & 2030 (tableau visuals)About the Test Subjects(tableau visuals)\nLimitations\nAt the time of this project, WHO had a website error that prevented us from pulling data from Europe and a few other countries. After finding most of that data, we came to the conclusion that some areas that data may not have been collected from some of those places.\nOur dataset for the machine learning aspect only contained data from the Frankfurt population.

Hence, there is increase in the number of people with type 2 diabetes worldwide. Only in United states of America, approximately 30.3 million people were identified as suffering from diabetes and 1.5 million Americans are being diagnosed with diabetes each year. The population studied was the PIMA Indian tribe women population near Phoenix, Arizona, United States. The tribe has been under continuous study since 1965 by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases due to it’s high incidence and prediabetes rate of diabetes.\nSince in women pregnancy seems to be a factor. According to World Health Organization Criteria, which stated that “if the 2-hour post-load glucose was at least 200 mg/dl at any survey exam or if the Indian Health Service Hospital serving the community found a glucose concentration of at least 200 mg/dl during routine medical care”. Given the data about PIMA, we will be trying to make predictions on how likely a PIMA Indian women is to suffer from diabetes, and therefore, act appropriately towards it. We can start analyzing statistical data that will help us study the onset of diabetes in Pima Indian women.\nFeatures\nPregnancies: Number of times pregnant.\nGlucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.\nBloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).\nSkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).\nInsulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).\nBMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)2).\nDiabetesPedigreeFunction: iabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history).\nAge: No explanation needed.\nSteps\n\nData Cleaning\nChecking Normality of Data (QQ-Plots, Cullen and Frey Graph)\nConverting the distribution of fields to Normal Distribution\nData Visualization (Joint density plot and joint boxplot)\nHypothesis Testing (Paired t-test)\nCorrelation Heat map\nLogistic Regression Model to Predict Diabetes\n\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/Mitul97', 'info_list': ['R', 'Updated Aug 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 5, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 3, 2020', 'Updated Aug 5, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 9, 2020', 'Rebol', 'Updated Aug 4, 2020', '1', 'Updated Aug 8, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 8, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [['1', '          follower'], ['1', '          following'], ['6']], 'contributions': '25 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/soumodeep46', 'info_list': ['R', 'Updated Aug 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 5, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 3, 2020', 'Updated Aug 5, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 9, 2020', 'Rebol', 'Updated Aug 4, 2020', '1', 'Updated Aug 8, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 8, 2020']}","{'location': 'NONE', 'stats_list': [], 'contributions': '79 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['NONE'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/siddhartha4u2c', 'info_list': ['R', 'Updated Aug 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 5, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 3, 2020', 'Updated Aug 5, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 9, 2020', 'Rebol', 'Updated Aug 4, 2020', '1', 'Updated Aug 8, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 8, 2020']}","{'location': 'Bengaluru', 'stats_list': [['0', '          followers'], ['6', '          following'], ['4']], 'contributions': '44 contributions\n        in the last year', 'description': ['Predicting-Diabetes-Using-Machine-Learning\nIn this project, Using KNN algorithm we are predicting that person has diabetes or not.\n'], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/raktim007', 'info_list': ['R', 'Updated Aug 28, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 5, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 3, 2020', 'Updated Aug 5, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 9, 2020', 'Rebol', 'Updated Aug 4, 2020', '1', 'Updated Aug 8, 2020', '1', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 4, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 8, 2020']}"

The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.\nBuild a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.\nDataset Description\nThe datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more.\nVariables\tDescription\nPregnancies\tNumber of times pregnant\nGlucose\tPlasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test\nBloodPressure\tDiastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)\nSkinThickness\tTriceps skinfold thickness (mm)\nInsulin\tTwo hour serum insulin\nBMI\tBody Mass Index\nDiabetesPedigreeFunction\tDiabetes pedigree function\nAge\tAge in years\nOutcome\tClass variable (either 0 or 1). 268 of 768 values are 1, and the others are 0\nProject Task: Week 1\nData Exploration:\n\nPerform descriptive analysis. Understand the variables and their corresponding values. On the columns below, a value of zero does not make sense and thus indicates missing value:\n\n• Glucose\n• BloodPressure\n• SkinThickness\n• Insulin\n• BMI\n\n\nVisually explore these variables using histograms. Treat the missing values accordingly.\n\n\nThere are integer and float data type variables in this dataset. Create a count (frequency) plot describing the data types and the count of variables.\n\n\nProject Task: Week 2\nData Exploration:\n\n\nCheck the balance of the data by plotting the count of outcomes by their value. Describe your findings and plan future course of action.\n\n\nCreate scatter charts between the pair of variables to understand the relationships. Describe your findings.\n\n\nPerform correlation analysis. Visually explore it using a heat map.\n\n\nProject Task: Week 3\nData Modeling:\n\n\nDevise strategies for model building. It is important to decide the right validation framework. Express your thought process.\n\n\nApply an appropriate classification algorithm to build a model. Compare various models with the results from KNN algorithm.\n\n\nProject Task: Week 4\nData Modeling:\n\nCreate a classification report by analyzing sensitivity, specificity, AUC (ROC curve), etc. Please be descriptive to explain what values of these parameter you have used.\n\nData Reporting:\n\nCreate a dashboard in tableau by choosing appropriate chart types and metrics useful for the business.

The incredibly destructive pandemic made entire social and economic structures crumble. With social distancing in most of the world, communities and personal feelings of connection felt lost. Under quarantine orders, the already overworked middle class was unable to work. Amidst all the chaos, particular groups of individuals face higher risks and stakes associated with a potential contraction of COVID-19 and thus must take extra precautions to limit exposure. Among these groups include adults 65 and older, individuals with respiratory diseases, those with diabetes, and more.\nHow we built it: Dividing up the project into three modules, each team member took a crash course in back-end microservices, database management, and front-end web development. We built APIs that when invoked with information from someone seeking help, would add their name to a database. Similarly, another API adds volunteer information to its respective database. By parsing the database, we matched up volunteers and individuals needing assistance based on criteria such as services requested/offered and location relative to each other and returned that list to the volunteer who may fulfill the request.\nChallenges we ran into: The biggest challenge was the limited time in which we all had to learn our respective parts. Preethi (me), Aishwarya, and Raymond had to take a crash course on how to build and scale a web application, along with relevant coding in JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and working with neDB along the way.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of: We are immensely proud to put together a minimum viable product in such a short period of time. It took a lot of fast-paced innovation, learning, and building. Additionally, our great communication skills allowed us to help each other and make sure that our project was on track for completion. Finally, our resolve to help our communities in this time of great need motivates us to continue working on this project in order well past the PlexHacks Hackathon.\nWhat we learned: Along with our newfound full-stack technical skills and the ability to build/scale web applications, we improved our skills on adaptability. We understand that one of the most important qualities of a computer scientist and developer is the ability to learn on the job and get work done on a deadline. These were put to the test, along with our ability to openly communicate, and we managed to pull through.\nWhat's next for Helping Hands: As previously mentioned, our resolve to helping our communities, especially members whom are most vulnerable, will drive us to continue working on this project. Shortly, we hope to deploy and put this product to use. Finally, post-pandemic, we believe that this technology and application can be adapted to suit the needs of the ever-changing world by continually providing our community with the help it needs.\n""], 'url_profile': 'https://github.com/preethi-muthukumaran', 'info_list': ['Updated Aug 7, 2020', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Updated Aug 8, 2020', '1', 'Updated Aug 8, 2020', '1', 'Updated Aug 9, 2020']}",,,,,,
