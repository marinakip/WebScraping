"Oxford, UK",4,3,22,281, qdiabetes general info this project is an r package for calculating the risk of developing type 2 diabetes the package uses r implementations of the qdiabetes algorithms which were initially derived by clinrisk using the c programming language the qdiabetes package comprises qdiabetes 2013 and qdiabetes 2018 although older and eventually more recent versions of qdiabetes may be included in future releases disclaimer clinrisk do not support of endorse this code end users should see the original c source as the gold standard open source implementation please note that the qdiabetes r package has been created as a research tool for scientific purposes only the qdiabetes r package has not been granted medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra approval as a medical device and hence should not be used as part of any individualised risk assessment history the first qdiabetes algorithm termed qdscore at the time was published in 20091 in 2011 two substantial changes were made whereby the age range permissible by the algorithm was expanded from 25 79 to 25 84 and the smoking status variable was expanded from two levels current smoker and non smoker to five levels non smoker ex smoker light smoker 1 9 day moderate smoker 10 19 day and heavy smoker 20 day in 2012 qdiabetes 2013 was released and from 2013 to 2016 the algorithm coefficients were periodically updated until 2017 when the more expansive qdiabetes 2018 algorithm was published2 at some point along the way qdiabetes switched from sourcing townsend deprivation data from the 2001 to the 2011 uk census however the point at which this occurred is not clear for now all the can be said for certain is that the original 2009 qdscore algorithm used townsend data from the 2001 uk census while qdiabetes 2018 uses townsend data from the 2011 uk census more details about the variables used in qdiabetes 2013 and qdiabetes 2018 can be found in the following sections qdiabetes 2013 the qdiabetes 2013 algorithm consists of two separate risk prediction models one per gender in which the following 11 variables are used to calculate risk gender sex female female male male age age in years body mass index bmi in kg m2 ethnicity ethn nine categories white or not stated whitena indian indian pakistani pakistani bangladeshi bangladeshi black caribbean blackcaribbean black african blackafrican chinese chinese other asian otherasian other ethnic group other smoking status smoke five levels non smoker non ex smoker ex light smoker 1 9 day light moderate smoker 10 19 day moderate heavy smoker 20 day heavy deprivation tds as measured by townsend scores where higher values indicate higher levels of deprivation family history of diabetes in first degree relative fhdm history of treated hypertension htn being diagnosis of hypertension and treatment with at least one hypertensive drug history of cardiovascular disease cvd defined as ischaemic heart disease stroke or transient ischaemic attack history of use of corticosteroids ster listed in british national formulary chapter 6 3 2 including oral or injections of systemic prednisolone betamethasone cortisone depo medrone dexamethasone deflazacort efcortesol hydrocortisone methylprednisolone or triamcinolone survival time surv being the time period over which risk of developing type 2 diabetes is to be calculated the qdiabetes 2013 algorithm is implemented within the qdr2013 function of the qdiabetes package qdiabetes 2018 the qdiabetes 2018 algorithm is actually six separate risk predictions models three sub models subdivided by gender model a the basic core model model a uses the same risk predictors as qdiabetes 2013 with the omission of the survival time variable in favour of a fixed 10 year survival window and the addition of the following 6 variables history of gestational diabetes gdm women only history of polycystic ovary syndrome pcos women only history of learning disabilities learn history of schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder psy history of use of statins stat history of use of second generation atypical antipsychotics apsy including amisulpride aripiprazole clozapine lurasidone olanzapine paliperidone quetiapine risperidone sertindole and zotepine model a of the qdiabetes 2018 algorithm is implemented within the qdr2018a function of the qdiabetes package model b model b uses the same variables as model a with the addition of fasting plasma glucose level fpg in mmol l model b of the qdiabetes 2018 algorithm is implemented within the qdr2018b function of the qdiabetes package model c model c uses the same variables as model a with the addition of glycated haemoglobin a1c value hba1c in mmol mol model c of the qdiabetes 2018 algorithm is implemented within the qdr2018c function of the qdiabetes package installation you can install the released version of qdiabetes from cran with install packages qdiabetes alternatively the development version may be installed from github with if remotes in installed packages install packages remotes remotes install_github feakster qdiabetes package ethos in building this package we wanted to make something that was simple to write and easy to maintain kiss principles performant but compatible with the latest and older versions of r with this in mind we have written this package to be as faithful to r s core language as possible using minimal dependencies hence you will not find any rcpp here instead all functions have been written entirely in base r the only exception being the gettds function which uses the median function from the stats package although we may re write this at some point all other packages listed under suggests in the description file only serve to illustrate the use of qdiabetes in examples or vignettes or in testing the package the primary factor limiting the package s compatibility with older versions of r is the data storage method cran require us to use for the data frame backend of the gettds function owing to the memory footprint of this object 200mb we need to make use of xz compression to reduce the overall size of the package as much as possible xz compression was first implemented in r version 2 10 note many of the default values used in the risk prediction functions of this package were selected to be representative of a uk population these values are only intended to minimise the amount of typing required when using the risk prediction functions in an exploratory manner they are unlikely to be useful in a research setting and you would need to know the exact values to assign to all function parameters in order to make an accurate risk prediction hence while you can get risk predictions from the qdr2013 and qdr2018a functions through the specification of only sex age and bmi you would be assuming white or missing ethnicity non smoking status a townsend deprivation score of 0 and the complete absence of any relevant medical history conditions and concomitant drug therapies in the case of qdr2013 you would also be assuming that a 10 year risk window is desired examples below are some very simple examples using the qdiabetes package note that for convenience either bmi bmi or height ht and weight wt may be specified in any of the risk prediction functions in this package in the interest of making life a little easier a

connect the reader to your machine with a usb cable and it will upload all the data stored in the reader i had old data that i had exported from my reader that predates my use of tidepool and i wanted to upload it to tidepool the tools in this repository make this possible even if you don t have this need the tools here may be useful for querying your data in tidepool note that the tools here have had minimal testing and therefore may not work for your data always test any commands that modify data on a non production server first installation to run the tools in this repository you will need

Stillwater,1,2,20,38, logistic regression from scratch using numpy in this repository the pima indians diabetes dataset has been used to illustrate how to create a logistic regression model from scratch using vectorization of the predictor variables and gradient descent algorithm for cost minimization with the intuition of neural network the steps used to create the model are listed below 1 defining the activation function the model algorithm consists of linear transformation of predictor variables to predict the output which will give a numeric value thus to restrict those values in the range of 0 and 1 an activation function is used here we have used the sigmoid activation function here which is given by sigmoid z 1 1 e z 2 random initialization of parameters bias term and coefficients the parameters w and b have been initialized as 0 to start with with each iteration of the logistic regression algorithm the values are updated using the optimization function the w vector has the shape no of features in predictor 1 3 forward propagation in this step we do the activation conversion and compute the cost of the model which is given by 4 optimization using this function definition we optimize the cost function mentioned above and update the parameters to minimize the cost the gradients descent algorithm is used and using the algorithm the gradients of the w and b parameters are computed and the parameters are updated by using the following formula w w learning_rate dw and b b learning_rate db by running this function using loop for n no of iterations we reach a convergence point where the cost function doesn t decrease any further another important thing to note is the choice of learning rate learning rate shouldn t be too small to increase the computational expense or too large to overshoot the global minima thus we try the model algorithm with various learning rates to find out the rate which gives optimizes the cost function the best the final step is to create a predict function and calculate the accuracy of predicted alues from test set ,https://github.com/TrishlaM,MIT license

the world in all kind of situations including health care and health care related topics type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease that can start in early childhood and adolescence and it requires lifelong daily management including testing adjusting medication doses and diet management through various means when it comes to type 1 diabetes the options available for diabetics to improve their condition are extremely varied from medication to testing equipment to insulin delivering systems and continuous glucose monitors a lot of the care is administered by parents since the disease can commence very early in life and parents rely on online communities for advice and psychological support balkhi reid mcnamara geffken the diabetes online community the importance of forum use in parents of children with type 1 diabetes https onlinelibrary wiley com doi abs 10 1111 pedi 12110 we believe it is important to understand the sources of stress and the topics that present interest to people affected by type 1 diabetes as diabetic distress can impact the condition itself and it is studied as such polonsky fisher earles dudl lees mullan and jackson assessing psychosocial distress in diabetes development of the diabetes distress scale and we will therefore acquire data from the reddit type 1 diabetes thread for the past 100 days starting with february 18th and analyze these posts in order to find out the main topics of interest for type 1 diabetics we will use unsupervised machine learning to explore these posts unsupervised machine learning is a class of techniques used to find pattern in data tha data given to an unsupervised algorithm will not be labeled which means we will have only an input variable x and no corresponding varriable we will use k means in order to explore the clustering of our data and we will explore the silhouette score in order to obtain the best clustering choices provided data ffor this project we have acquired data by scrapping from reddit using pushshift s api from the type 1 diabetes reddit subthread we have this process in the notebook diabetes_scrapping ipynb data dictionary for diabetes_t1_2 csv feature type description title object post title selftext object post text subreddit object subreddit thread created_utc int time author object author num_comments int number of comments score int score is_self bool is this the original post or a repost timestamp object time executive summary we have obtained a set of data that contains posts from the the type 1 diabetes subreddit thread for 100 days from 2019 starting back from february 18th 2020 after dropping all the empty rows in our data we are left with a total of 4283 posts our target is to analyze these posts using natural language processing unsupervised machine learning and the k means clustering and see if any meaningful clustering will emerge that will help us identify the topics of interest that emerge in the type 1 diabetic online community k means is a method of vector quantization that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining which aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean serving as a prototype of the cluster after we import our data we tokenize it in order to clean the text and get it ready to be vectorized we ran both countvectorizer and tfidf vectorizers on our text and realized that tfidf will make a better candidate for preprocessing our data in order to be clustered with the k means model we have then decided to use tfidf with a maximum number of 10000 features that is tokenized words in our case once we have ran tfidf on our posts and obtained our sparse matrix we proceeded to use it in order to calculate the silhouette score for a number of k clusters between 5 and 50 we aimed to find the highest silhouette score in order to find the best clustering however as soon as we ran our search and plotted our inertia and silhouette scores we noticed that the silhouette score is very small starts at 0 004 and at k 50 it starts to hover at 0 01 and that means for us that we wont be able to use it very efficiently in order to choose our cluster number still we use the first observed elbow in our silhouette graph at k 6 and we decide on a clustering on 6 centroids we then proceed to analyze each cluster and the words that have the highest tfidf sum in the specific cluster and their general frequency in the cluster that way we will see what topics emerge from our analysis drawbacks conclusions and further steps one of the drawbacks of this study is the limited number of posts possibly with more than 100 days and more than 4200 posts we would have had more information about the topics of interest for type 1 diabetics at the same time another limitation is the very close clustering with the small silhouette score a clustering on about 30 clusters would have made a small difference as the silhouette score would have been 0 01 and not 0 06 but clustering on 30 clusters with only 4200 posts felt like it will become too granular another drawback was the presence of the removed posts which for further studies will have to be handled on a case by case basis and removed posts will have to be verified individually before they can be dropped from the dataframe we conclude that the topics of interest for diabetics fall into several categories the largest group has to do with broadly with health insurance and the blood tests that are considered essential for monitoring how well a diabetic s condition is managed a very large one composed actually of three clusters we found is the technology a type 1 diabetic can use in order to manage their condition continuous glucose monitors of various kinds and the pumps that can be used to administer the insulin without daily injections and all the connected issues and the third large group has to do with managing the low blood sugar episodes the high blood sugar episodes disruption of sleep and the general diet followed after this brief study we can see that the sources of stress as reflected by topics of discussion on the reddit forum seem to fall under a couple of categories health insurance and lack thereof managing the technology used for monitoring the blood sugar and administering insulin managing episodes of low or high blood sugar and how they impact the diabetic s nights at the same time we can safely draw the conclusion that the existence of online forums where type 1 diabetics exchange opinions offers comfort and help to thousand of people suffering from this condition this is a daily struggle and the people that understand it the best are people suffering from the same condition from advice about technology to a mere cry for help or compassion social media can help diabetics feel less isolated and get emotional support in a direct way from peers further steps we would like to explore this subject further by acquiring more data and obtaining a stronger capacity processor in order to find out if the clustering would look different on more than 4200 posts the most important find that we would like to explore further is the fact that night disruption in type 1 diabetics is not explored as much as we would have thought exploring this topic would potentially lead to solutions that could improve a diabetic s quality of life ,https://github.com/adrianavesa,"Updated Mar 11, 2020"

was as one of several small projects of one developer who was trying to gain traction on the android platform this project soon evolved into a vision named diaguard which saw its initial release in july 2014 since then it has received many updates much appreciated feedback from its users and a little bit of marketing with the help of direct contact and mouth to mouth propaganda but at the end of the day every line of code has been provided by one sole developer in his spare time this should change in april 2020 when the decision was made to go open source goals diaguard should help diabetics with monitoring their diabetes it should be able to replace the handwritten diary completely and to supplement tasks like basal rate tests or carb counting it should help diabetologists with monitoring their patients regularly and when preparing a health insurance application diaguard s users should always be and feel in full control all user generated data must stay on the same device until the user explicitely decides to transfer something to another device e g during an export or backup nothing is shared with remote services and network is only used to read data from a food database user data must not be lost therefor database migrations enable user data to be carried from version 1 0 to any existing and upcoming release diaguard should be accessible to most people therefor its design is heavily influenced by the material design guidelines and tested with accessibility tools like talkback and accessibility scanner diaguard should only be used under the supervision of a diabetologist diaguard should not be used by minors without the supervision of a parent or legal guardian diaguard is not a medical app and serves no therapeutical purpose business model there is none diaguard exists for three reasons for learning for fun and for saying thank you this app kickstarted the career of a professional software developer by leading through the whole software lifecycle creating a concept building software from scratch publishing it to the masses and maintaining a legacy project with additions sprinkled here and there additionally it was and is pure fun to enhance this app and to see feedback from a helpful and thankful community last but not least diaguard is a way of giving something back for these reasons diaguard has been is and will always be free of cost if you want to buy me a beer or support me in general please use the donate button and be aware of my thanks development languages english is used as general language for naming things everything except the localization should be written in english java is used as programming language currently there are no plans to migrate to kotlin to prevent a multi language project a possible approach could be splitting up the monolith into multiple modules which unleashes the potential to switch language while staying consistent within a module sqlite is used as query language for the database object relational mapping takes then place via ormlite xml is used as markup language for user interfaces these views are then bound to java via butter knife localization localization takes place locally and affects following components user interfaces localized via android resources one strings xml per language common food localized via custom file import one food_common csv for all languages default tags localized via custom file import one tags csv for all languages currently the localization process requires certain programming skills this should and could be improved by using an external service in order to support localizations by non developers architecture there are two architectural design patterns that are being used for diaguard model view controller and domain driven design model view controller mvc was a widely spread design pattern in the early days of android development until google presented its architecture components in 2017 and model view viewmodel mvvm took over a gradual transition to mvvm is planned due to its advantages over mvc e g regarding encapsulation and testability domain driven design improves the structure by grouping files in features every feature describes one aspect of the project and should be self contained to improve focus during development the only exception to this rule is the shared package which contains everything that is used in multiple features e g database or networking logic testing testing takes place via junit espresso and robolectric tests are few in number and far from perfect since most of diaguard has been developed in the early of days of one developer however the decision to go open source came with a code of conduct and instrumentation testing major features was the first step in a right direction the goal now is to unit and instrumentation test every new and edited feature in order to increase the quality with every commit third party licenses this software uses following

inside of the themes directory of sddm after that you will have to point sddm to the new theme by editing its config file preferrably at etc sddm conf create if necessary you can take the default config file of sddm as a reference which might be found at usr lib sddm sddm conf d sddm conf in the theme section simply add the themes name to this line current sugar candy if you don t care for

"Itajubá, MG",3,1,5,42, diabetes onset detection with dnn the main objective of this project is to use a deep neural network to predict the onset of diabetes for a set of patients summary in this project we build a dnn and found the optimal hyperparameters using the scikit learn grid search we also learned how to optimize a network by tuning the hyperparameters the results that we get might not be the same for all of us but as long as we get similar predictions we can consider our model a success when you start training on new data or if you are trying to address a different problem with another dataset you will have to go through this process again created by costaruan ,https://github.com/costaruan,"Updated Apr 16, 2020"

United States,1,0,10,52, task diabetes is a highly prevalent and expensive chronic condition costing about 330 billion to americans annually most of the cost is attributed to the type 2 version of diabetes which is typically diagnosed in middle age today is december 31 2016 a commercial health insurance company has contracted you to predict which of their members are most likely to be newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in your goal is to featurize their data train and optimize a predictive model and explain your results and approach note newly diagnosed means members who were u200b not previously coded u200bwith diabetes u200bprior u200b to 2016 12 31 inclusive details about the dataset the data provided are real patient claims records from a large insurance company appropriately de identified the data sets have already been split into training and test sets train txt test txt the proportions of members are about 70 train and 30 test each line in both text files is a patient record represented as a json string the health record is parameterized by a set of encounter dates in a yyyy mm dd format the structure of each patient json is as follows bday patient date of birth in yyyy mm dd format is_male true male false female patient_id de identified patient id each patient is given a unique value resources dictionary of encounter_date list of codes described below observations dictionary of encounter_date list of dictionaries described below tag_dm2 indicates date of first type 2 diabetes diagnosis will either have a yyyy mm dd date or be an empty string this information will be censored from the holdout set described above split indicates a member is in the train or test set u200binformation beyond 2017 01 has been u200b removed u200b from test txt u200b each patient record has a key tag_dm2 whose value is u200b either u200b a yyyy mm dd date string indicating the date of first code of a diagnosis of diabetes u200b or u200b an empty string indicating no diabetes in their record your task is to predict each test set member s probability of being u200bnewly diagnosed u200b with diabetes in 2017 information for u200beach test set member s u200b health record beyond 2017 01 01 has been removed the true diabetes status of the member is hidden from you and will be used by lumiata s data science team to evaluate your solution you should cohort your data i e construct the response variable in the training set according to the following definitions check your work with the training set counts given below for each definition a u200bclaim u200b is someone whose tag_dm2 date is between 2017 01 01 and 2017 12 31 inclusive training set count of claim 3410 the response for these members is a 1 a u200bnever claim u200b is someone whose tag_dm2 date is u200b either u200b after 2017 12 31 exclusive or u200b is an empty string training set count of never claim 70110 the response for these members is a 0 a u200bprior u200b is someone whose tag_dm2 date is u200b before u200b 2017 01 01 exclusive typically priors are filtered out of the matrix before training you may include these people in training but keep in mind they will be filtered out of test when we evaluate your solution each patient record also has two keys describing their health history resources observations the resources key specifies the diagnoses medications and procedures that were noted prescribed performed at each doctor s visit these are represented by different coding systems icd9 10 rxnorm cpt respectively each encounter date in the resources key is mapped to the corresponding list of codes issued at that doctor s visit the codes have the format _ for instance icd9_272 0 which corresponds to high cholesterol http www icd9data com 2015 volume1 240 279 270 279 272 272 0 htm note u200b encounter dates in resources can sometimes have no codes in the code list the observations key specifies the lab tests that were completed each encounter date is mapped to a list of dictionaries each of which has the following keys code the loinc code corresponding to the lab test interpretation whether the lab was h for high l for low n for normal or a for abnormal value the value extracted from the lab for instance the lab could have been a blood glucose test loinc_2345 7 whose value may have been 130 and hence whose interpretation would be h a cut off for high blood glucose is 106 https s details loinc org loinc 2345 7 html sections comprehensive u200b note u200b the values in the interpretation and value keys can sometimes be none the keys in the

affected and not affected by diabetes since the distribution somewhat remains the same for both and also the dataset is highly imbalanced exploring the interpretation of the lab tests feature this feature has been encoded into bag of words format hence we will have a column corresponding to each of the possible observed value for each test since this will be of very high dimensionality we will only be visualising the most important of these features that is the feature which has the most correlation with the label this will be identified using the seleckbest feature of sklearn bestfeatures

your approach be sure to include the following top 5 most important features for predicting diabetes have a rationale for why you think these are most important briefly describe the model you used for training explain how you optimized your model and what performance metrics you optimized for how did you prevent overfitting top 5 most important features for predicting diabetes the most important feature i could observe after deep exploration of the data was the feature called icd10_e11 this feature was extracted from the resources key under the record of each patient the reason why i think this feature is the most important is because it acted as a direct signal to let me know if a person is affected by type ii diabetes or not this is because icd10_e11 is actually the code which indicates type ii diabetes in medical literature hence acting sort of like a label by itself the above fact can also be proven by looking at the coefficients of the line which seperates the classes in logistic regression we can interpret this fact by looking at the coefficients we can very well observe below that the fourth number below corresponds to the feature icd10_e11 and this is the largest number of all thereby proving that its the most important feature clf coef_ array 0 02167449 0 13493343 0 03281268 1 34845179 0 01319281 the 2nd most indicative feature to me was the feature which was obtained from the observations key of each patients record this was the interpreatation of the lab test loinc_4548 4 this was encoded into bag of words and this being high turned out to be a very important feature only the fact that it was high or not was retained in a single column of vector the scientific reason why this is so important is because this indicates the level of haemogloibin haemoglobin is a compound which directly affects the blood glucose level because it carries glucose molecules in it and therefore blood glucose level increase leads to the condition of diabetes this again can be observed from the output of coefficients above where the second number is the second largest the next most important feature that i could see from exploring the data was the age of a person this feature was designed using the bithday dates of each patient the age of a person had a good correlation with the fact that a person was affected by diabetes or not this is because a person above the age 60 is more likely to get affected by type ii diabetes and a person below the age 20 was less likely to be affected by this this was observed by observing the distribution pertaining to both the classes 4 another very important feature that i found from the dataset was the code icd10_i10 which relates to hypertension in medical literature this again influences the fact that a person will have diabetes or not by a large factor a paper states that there is a very large relation between hypertension and diabetes https care diabetesjournals org content 40 9 1273 5 another important feature that i personally engineered was a combination of multiple codes indicating various health conditions in medical literature cpt_99232 icd10_i25 icd10_j96 icd10_e78 icd10_j44 icd10_i50 icd10_n18 cpt_83036 this was again obtained from the features key in the dataset these were the most imporatant features indicated by selectkbest but they did not have any significant effect when individually added to the model but they ended up having a very significant effect when added up together the sum was taken after bow encoding the distribution of the sum of these features was observed and it indicated a significant difference in the way it was distributed for patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes model used for training why was logistic regression chosen the model that the data was finally trained on was logistic regression model a decision tree was also tried out and a decision tree with a depth of 4 gave the same exact performance of logistic regression since logistic regression gave results on par with decision tree it was chosen to model the data rather than decision trees the reason for this being logistic regression is a simpler model and if it gives such a good performance it is sort of indicative that the data is linearly seperable specifications of the model logistic regression is a simple classification algorithm to seperate linearly seperable data the data that it was trained on had about 5 features hence we had to train 5 parameters for the model also l2 regularisation was used optimisation of the model i personally believe that one of the most important thing for a data scientist is exploring at the data and gathering the best features from it hence i spent most of my initial time engineering the features and making sure to get the best out of them most of the important features was explored using various plots and the best were retained the model was later optimized for best performance using a single fold cross validation we just had one parameter to tune that is the coefficient of the regularisation term a linear search across different values of the regularisation parameter was done and we obtained the best regularisation parameter value to be 10 4 the metric used to evaluate this was prauc same as average precision score the precision recall curve for different values of the hyperparameter was also plotted and then the best model was choosen by looking at the metrics and the curve and taking into consideration the bias variance tradeoff the threshold value of the model was chosen to be 0 4 this was done because with a standard threshold of 0 5 we were getting more false negatives than false positives in a medical application we are always okay with a person being falsely clssified to have a disease because in that case he can always take a second opinion but he she cannot be falsely diagnosed with having no disease since that could be really dangerous to the person by changing threshold we had slightly more false positives but we reduced the false negatives by a lot how overfitting was prevented overfitting here was prevented using l2 regularisation i searched linearly across various values of the regularisation parameter and the best value was obtained using cross validation the best value was found to be 10 4 ,https://github.com/prashusat,Python

iii clinical trial testing it is a very unique and sensitive drug that requires administering and screening the drug over at least 5 7 days of time in the hospital with frequent monitoring testing and patient medication adherence training with a mobile application you have been provided a patient dataset from a client partner and are tasked with building a predictive model that can identify which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on target patients are people that are likely to be in the hospital for this duration of time and will not incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring in order to achieve your goal you must build a regression model that can predict the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and use this to select filter patients for your study expected hospitalization time regression model utilizing a synthetic dataset denormalized at the line level augmentation built off of the uci diabetes readmission dataset students will build a regression model that predicts the expected days of hospitalization time and then convert this to a binary prediction of whether to include or exclude that patient from the clinical trial this project will demonstrate the importance of building the right data representation at the encounter level with appropriate filtering and preprocessing

New York,1,18,9,12, vapi tools cli this set of tools is a collection of tools developed to drive the powerai vision api for test purposes each tool is small and directed at a specific api endpoint since testing the api endpoints was the primary purpose of the tools most have very little if any validation of inputs and the create tools usually require json for the input this approach was chosen so that it would be easy to drive invalid input to the endpoints and to provide raw json to validate endpoint output unfortunately this approach does not make them very user friendly not only are parameters not validated but tools are not task based for example deplopyed models are manipulated managed via the webapi tools to deploy a model the createwebapi tool is used even though the tools have usability shortcomings they are being shared at this time to provide examples of how the api can be accessed using python the api documentation is included in this repo in the file vision docs powerai vision api html or at this link to get the rendered html usage setup the tools require the python requests package other than that all other packages are part of the base python installation you must set pythonpath to include the directory containing vapi_core py as this file is imported by all commands configuration there are 2 required pieces of configuration one for the server hosting powerai vision and one for user authentication information in release 1 1 1 0 mutli user support was added this capability requires a token be passed instead of user authentication the token can be obtained via the getvisiontokenpass command once obtained the token must be saved in the exported environment variable vapi_token the toolset is setup to look for the vapi_token environment variable first if found the toolset will use the multi user authentication method if the vapi_token is not set the toolset will look for the authentication information in the config file described below a json config file is used to obtain the server information as well as other optional configuration information the config file provides the following information hostname identifies the powerai vision server to contact this parameter is required auth used for release 1 1 0 0 authentication loglevel indicates the level of logging detail see the logging section below for more details for example hostname powerai vision server mycompany com auth user1 mypassw0rd loglevel 40 note that the attribute for authentication information is capitalized and will only be used if the vapi_token environment variable described previously is not found the file path to the config file can be identified via the vapi_cfg environment variable or the file home vapi cfg is the default file path use of the envirnment variable makes it easier to access different powerai vision servers logging the tools use the pthon logging facility the level is controled via an optional field in the vapi_cfg file this field is loglevel and values must be numeric debug 10 info 20 warn 30 error 40 critical 50 this level is not used in the tools currently logging goes to stderr which can be redirected on the command line note that to see more details about the interaction the api endpoints setting loglevel to 10 input limitations for creating objects in the current form each create command requires a json string as input this string contains the information to be sent to the api this approach was chosen because it was the easiest to code in python and it also allows a way to provide invalid input with which to test the api note that for some of the commands argument flags are now supported try the command with no parameters or with help to get a usage statement tools of special note getvisiontokenpass getvisiontokenpass is the tool that will get an access token given a user name and password as input as mentioned previously a token is required to access the powerai vision api endpoints in versions 1 1 1 0 and later inference tools more information and documentation on doing inferences is being worked for now the best example for inferences is the classify_dir script which will classify all images in a given directory and summarize the results into a csv file an object detection script will be added in the future eventmonitor eventmonitor can be used to monitor the sse events for a particular user with the introduction of multi user support in version 1 1 1 0 events are generated on a user by user basis such that usera will not see userb s events and vice versa non api commands

patient medication adherence training with a mobile application you have been provided a patient dataset from a client partner and are tasked with building a predictive model that can identify which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on target patients are people that are likely to be in the hospital for this duration of time and will not incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring in order to achieve your goal you must build a regression model that can predict the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and use this to select filter patients for your study expected hospitalization time regression model utilizing a synthetic dataset denormalized at the line level augmentation built off of the uci diabetes readmission dataset students will build a regression model that predicts the expected days of hospitalization time and then convert this to a binary prediction of whether to include or exclude that patient from the clinical trial this project will demonstrate the importance of building the right data representation at the encounter level with appropriate filtering and preprocessing

provided by the original categorical bin from the data set race categorical a dummy variable for one of asian caucasian hispanic other african american was the dropped dummy variable admission_type_id categorical a dummy variable where the option is either 3 representing elective admission or not which would identify the encounter as an emergency admission discharge_disposition_id categorical a dummy variable for either 3 4 5 6 2 was the dropped dummy variable 2 6 represent continued care expired no additional care short term care and hospice respectively a1cresults categorical a dummy variable for test results that show whether a patient s levels of blood glucose over the past 3 months has not changed remained normal increased 8 or increased 7 insulin categorical a dummy variable to indicate whether insulin was not prescribed or whether it was held steady increased or decreased the target variable will be readmitted which classifies whether the patient was readmitted or there was no record of readmission modeling following a logistic regression model following the application of principal component analysis for feature reduction the gridsearch cross validataion process was used to optimize parameters for a number of models including a singular decision tree a bagging classifier bagged decision tree a random forest an adaptive boosted forest and an xg boosted forest because the cost of a false negative has a different cost than a false positive i scored the models on their roc_auc score and selected the final model on the highest class weighted f1 score here are the python libraries utlized for this analysis results the models had fairly low capability of class separability the xgboost classifier returned a performance that showed model capability of 64 5 roughly two thirds of patients would be correctly identified as a readmit or non readmit see the roc_auc for the optimized xgbclassifier model here while this was the overall outcome the models had different outcomes when we examined the predictions of the individual classes the coding of the target variable was 0 non readmit and 1 readmit you can see in the above that the model was much better at predicting patients who were non readmits vs those patients who would ultimately be readmitted this drove up the false negative rate actual readmits predicted to be non readmits causing recall sensitivity to suffer unfortunately false negatives are potentially more costly to hospital s preparedness to handle a large influx of patients or to predict bed availability finally we were able to understand which features would push prediction outcomes one way or the other as you can see the greater the number of inpatient and emergency room visits a patient has had in the year before the observed encounter the more likely they are to be predicted to readmit in the future patients discharge to hospice id_6 are less likely to return they might likely expire in hospice services conclusion additional analysis could be conducted by reintroducing the discharge diagnosis codes given their variety they were initally discarded so some medical expertise could be helpful in bucketing those we could also search for additional information on these patients to better understand how the type of diabetes affects readmittance rates ,https://github.com/zachzazueta,"Updated Aug

patient medication adherence training with a mobile application you have been provided a patient dataset from a client partner and are tasked with building a predictive model that can identify which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on target patients are people that are likely to be in the hospital for this duration of time and will not incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring in order to achieve your goal you must build a regression model that can predict the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and use this to select filter patients for your study expected hospitalization time regression model utilizing a synthetic dataset denormalized at the line level augmentation built off of the uci diabetes readmission dataset students will build a regression model that predicts the expected days of hospitalization time and then convert this to a binary prediction of whether to include or

incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring in order to achieve the goal a regression model must be created that can predict the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and use this to select filter patients for the study expected hospitalization time regression model utilizing a synthetic dataset denormalized at the line level augmentation built off of the uci diabetes readmission dataset we will build a regression model that predicts the expected days of hospitalization time and then convert this to a binary prediction of whether to include or exclude that patient from the clinical trial this project will demonstrate the importance of building the right data representation at the encounter level with appropriate filtering and preprocessing feature engineering of key medical code sets this project will also require us to analyze and interpret their model for biases across key demographic groups dataset due to healthcare phi regulations hipaa hitech there are limited number of publicly available datasets and some datasets require training and approval so for the purpose of this exercise we are using a

clinical trial testing it is a very unique and sensitive drug that requires administering and screening the drug over at least 5 7 days of time in the hospital with frequent monitoring testing and patient medication adherence training with a mobile application you have been provided a patient dataset from a client partner and are tasked with building a predictive model that can identify which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on target patients are people that are likely to be in the hospital for this duration of time and will not incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring in order to achieve your goal you must build a regression model that can predict the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and use this to select filter patients for your study expected hospitalization time regression model utilizing a synthetic dataset denormalized at the line level augmentation built off of the uci diabetes readmission dataset students will build a regression model that predicts the expected days of hospitalization time and then convert this to a binary prediction of whether to include or exclude that patient from the clinical trial this project will demonstrate the importance of building the right data representation at the encounter level with appropriate filtering and preprocessing

"Boulder, CO",1,2,3,151, pima indians diabetes project the point of this project is to determine if someone has diabetes based on data given from the pima indians diabetes database this dataset is originally from the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases the objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database in particular all patients here are females at least 21 years old of pima indian heritage the dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable outcome predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had their bmi insulin level age and so on project overview in this project i created a model with 85 accuracy that predicts if a patient has diabetes based on various health measures to help doctors focus on certain patients used matplotolib seaborn to visualize the data and understand it better engineered features from the data to quantify the value certain health factors such as bmi have on a patient s diagnosis optimized gradient boost classifier using gridsearchcv to reach the best model productionized the model by pickling it into an object that can used in the future code and resources used python version 3 8 packages pandas numpy sklearn matplotlib seaborn pickle xgboost data cleaning after downloading the data from kaggle i took a look at it and saw that there were some missing values these values came in the form of zeros for example nobody can have a bmi value of 0 to avoid this issue i dropped rows with a missing glucose value imputed missing insulin values using the median of the insulin column imputed missing blood pressurve values using the median of the blood pressure column imputed missing bmi values using the median of the bmi column scaled the dataset to standardize the independent features present in the data and prevent machine learning algorithms from weighing greater values higher and consider smaller values as the lower values model building i split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20 testing phase i decided to use this project as a time to test out as many classification models as i could so that i would be able to learn how each one worked at this time i did not scale my data so some of these models might not be as accurate as they could have been during this testing phase i used the following models logisticregression ridgeclassifier baggingclassifier gaussiannb linearsvc decisiontreeclassifier randomforestclassifier kneighborsclassifier svc xgbclassifier i used a for loop to gather the accuracy of each model which probably was not the best idea next time it would make more sense to have a pipeline for each model and run that to evaluate each model i decided to use a classification report so that i could see how many predictions are true and how many are false more specifically true positives false positives true negatives and false negatives after completing this project i see that the function of these models are quite similar and yield interchangeable results the top performers of this phase were linearsvc logisticregression and the ridgeclassifier they all had an accuracy of 0 69 each of these models work in a very similar fashion which helps me understand why all three models had identical f1 scores these f1 sores were very hit or miss all of the models had an f1 score of 0 82 for outcomes of 0 but for the outcome 1 their scores were stuck at 0 real model building after this testing phase i thought that i had gained enough knowledge through research to improve my model selection and development i selected four models random forest classifier xgboost classifier knn classifier gradient boost classifier i chose these models because they all had enough variation in their functionality that i thought would be useful due to their evaluation methods for this classification problem the random forest classifier is well random xgboost uses a number of nifty tricks like computing second order gradients i e second partial derivatives of the loss function similar to newton s method the knn classifier finds the distances between a query and all the examples in the data selecting the specified number examples k closest to the query then votes for the most frequent label and finally the gradient boost classifier uses the loss function of the base model e g random forest as a proxy for minimizing the error of the overall model model performance the random forest model far outperformed the other approaches on the test and validation sets random forest classifier 0 771 xgboostclassifier 0 78 kneighborsclassifier 0 77 gradientboostingclassifier 0 85 the gradientboostingclassifier far outperformed the other approaches on the test and validation sets

"New York, NY",6,9,0,75, diabetes hospitalizations jean paul ventura introduction diabetes affects 30 million americans almost 10 of the population as of 2015 it is a family of diseases that affects how your body can utilize blood sugar specifically glucose while vital for powering your cells a buildup of glucose in the blood can lead to serious health problems type i diabetes usually emerges pre adolescence and is characterized by one s immune system incorrectly targeting insulin producing cells type ii can emerge at any age and is characterized by cells becoming resistent to insulin binding this keeps glucose from being transported into the cells and causes a buildup of glucose in the blood there are a plethora of factors that impact diabetes including genetics and environmental factors family history is the driving factor for type i diabetes for type ii diabetes in addition to family history there are many more environmental factors such as weight inactivity age race and other underlying health concerns hba1c is a measure of how glycated one s red blood cells are this gives a better picture of glucose levels over a few months rather than a single point test like blood glucose levels for diabetics just a 1 increase in hba1c can increase microvascular complications by 25 the model i used a logistic regression model to enable interpreting our coefficients and drawing relative comparisons between features a non polynomial model performed best and allowed for easier interpretation of coefficients i also tried a decision tree model but it consistently performed worse than our logistic regression even after iterative improvments using smote tomek links and gridsearch data collection cleaning the data set was a subset of some 75 million inpatient visits between 1998 and 2008 the specific dataset consists of 100 000 inpatient visits for only diabetic patients because this set spans ten years i had to remove repeat visits as some patients were admitted several times in that period the datset also had 25 features for specific diabetic treatments that had to be dropped as many were not used by any of our observations feature engineering i observed that the effect of age on readmittance was clearly different between different age ranges therefore i binned age into 0 30 30 60 and 60 100 categories various diagnoses were reported when patients were admitted inpatient via icd 9 medical billing codes but only the first three were listed it was intractable to use get_dummies due to the sheer number of possible diagnoses observed therefore i created columns for if diabetes icd 9 code 250 xx was listed as one of the top diagnoses from outside research i know that the hba1c test is very important for assessing long term management of glucose levels in the blood however less than 20 of inpatient visits resulted in a hba1c test furthermore if a patient was given a hba1c test one would hope that patient s medication would be adjusted if necessary having a feature for change in meds i was able to engineer a feature for when a patient likely needed an adjustment and if it was done or not insights and suggestions the main insight is that patients listed with diabetes as a top diagnosis for their inpatient visit were more likely to be later readmitted both within and after 30 days therefore steps that could lower diabetic visits would reduce rates of readmission this is generally accomplished through routine testing of blood sugar levels and less often hba1c tests to measure long term glucose levels of diabetic patients only 18 5 received a hba1c test and of those more than 50 had a change in medication during the visit presumably due to their results indeed patients who received a normal hba1c result were less likely to be readmitted age also played a large part in readmission rate generally older patients had higher rates than younger patients patients 60 100 were more likely to be readmitted within 30 days and patients 0 30 were less likely to be readmitted in either case while not surprising physicians should focus on testing older patients with hba1c interestingly patients who did not receive even the daily point blood sugar test were less likely to be readmitted within 30 days but more likely to be readmitted after 30 days this is potentially because arising issues went undiscovered during the inpatient visit necessitating a later visit future directions i encourage physicians to offer both blood sugar and hba1c tests for all diabetic inpatient visits regardless of the main cause of visit frequent testing will better capture emerging complications than waiting for adverse symptoms this sort of preventative testing is done in icus already because of the clear health benefits but it could be utilized in all inpatient cases even with more than 60 000 observations our dataset greatly underestimates the true population of diabetic patients in the united states an interesting next step would be to incorporate financial elements to the analysis diabetes treatment is quite expensive for the individual on average 17 000 per year per patient and for society 1 of every 4 healthcare spending is diabetes related we would attempt to assign cost benefit analysis to various testing and treatment options to optimize care and minimize costs ,https://github.com/jvntra,"Updated Aug 19, 2020"

New York City,19,6,2,407, diabetes hospitalizations aren carpenter jp ventura an interactive version of the final model is hosted on a web app on heroku for those who want to play around introduction diabetes affects 30 million americans almost 10 of the population as of 2015 it is a family of diseases that affects how your body can utilize blood sugar specifically glucose while vital for powering your cells a buildup of glucose in the blood can lead to serious health problems type i diabetes usually emerges pre adolescence and is characterized by one s immune system incorrectly targeting insulin producing cells type ii can emerge at any age and is characterized by cells becoming resistent to insulin binding this keeps glucose from being transported into the cells and causes a buildup of glucose in the blood there are a plethora of factors that impact diabetes including genetics and environmental factors family history is the driving factor for type i diabetes for type ii diabetes in addition to family history there are many more environmental factors such as weight inactivity age race and other underlying health concerns hba1c is a measure of how glycated one s red blood cells are this gives a better picture of glucose levels over a few months rather than a single point test like blood glucose levels for diabetics just a 1 increase in hba1c can increase microvascular complications by 25 the model we used a logistic regression model to enable interpreting our coefficients and drawing relative comparisons between features a non polynomial model performed best and allowed for easier interpretation of coefficients we also tried a decision tree model but it consistently performed worse than our logistic regression even after iterative improvments using smote tomek links and gridsearch data collection cleaning our data set was a subset of some 75 million inpatient visits between 1998 and 2008 the specific dataset consists of 100 000 inpatient visits for only diabetic patients because this set spans ten years we had to remove repeat visits as some patients were admitted several times in that period the datset also had 25 features for specific diabetic treatments that had to be dropped as many were not used by any of our observations feature engineering we observed that the effect of age on readmittance was clearly different between different age ranges therefore we binned age into 0 30 30 60 and 60 100 categories various diagnoses were reported when patients were admitted inpatient via icd 9 medical billing codes but only the first three were listed it was intractable to use get_dummies due to the sheer number of possible diagnoses we observed therefore we created columns for if diabetes icd 9 code 250 xx was listed as one of the top diagnoses from outside research we know that the hba1c test is very important for assessing long term management of glucose levels in the blood however less than 20 of inpatient visits resulted in a hba1c test furthermore if a patient was given a hba1c test one would hope that patient s medication would be adjusted if necessary as we had a feature for change in meds we were able to engineer a feature for when a patient likely needed an adjustment and if it was done or not insights and suggestions our main insight is that patients listed with diabetes as a top diagnosis for their inpatient visit were more likely to be later readmitted both within and after 30 days therefore steps that could lower diabetic visits would reduce rates of readmission this is generally accomplished through routine testing of blood sugar levels and less often hba1c tests to measure long term glucose levels of diabetic patients only 18 5 received a hba1c test and of those more than 50 had a change in medication during the visit presumably due to their results indeed patients who received a normal hba1c result were less likely to be readmitted age also played a large part in readmission rate generally older patients had higher rates than younger patients patients 60 100 were more likely to be readmitted within 30 days and patients 0 30 were less likely to be readmitted in either case while not surprising physicians should focus on testing older patients with hba1c interestingly patients who did not receive even the daily point blood sugar test were less likely to be readmitted within 30 days but more likely to be readmitted after 30 days this is potentially because arising issues went undiscovered during the inpatient visit necessitating a later visit future directions we encourage physicians to offer both blood sugar and hba1c tests for all diabetic inpatient visits regardless of the main cause of visit frequent testing will better capture emerging complications than waiting for adverse symptoms this sort of preventative testing is done in icus already because of the clear health benefits but it could be utilized in all inpatient cases even with more than 60 000 observations our dataset greatly underestimates the true population of diabetic patients in the united states an interesting next step would be to incorporate financial elements to the analysis diabetes treatment is quite expensive for the individual on average 17 000 per year per patient and for society 1 of every 4 healthcare spending is diabetes related we would attempt to assign cost benefit analysis to various testing and treatment options to optimize care and minimize costs an interactive version of the final model is hosted on a web app on heroku for those who want to play

phase iii clinical trial testing it is a very unique and sensitive drug that requires administering and screening the drug over at least 5 7 days of time in the hospital with frequent monitoring testing and patient medication adherence training with a mobile application you have been provided a patient dataset from a client partner and are tasked with building a predictive model that can identify which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on target patients are people that are likely to be in the hospital for this duration of time and will not incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring in order to achieve your goal you must build a regression model that can predict the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and use this to select filter patients for your study expected hospitalization time regression model utilizing a synthetic dataset denormalized at the line level augmentation built off of the uci diabetes readmission dataset students will build a regression model that predicts the expected days of hospitalization time and then convert this to a binary prediction of whether to include or exclude that patient from the clinical trial this project will demonstrate the importance of building the right data representation at the encounter level with appropriate filtering and preprocessing feature engineering of key medical code sets this project will also require students to analyze and interpret their model for biases across key demographic groups dataset due to healthcare phi regulations hipaa hitech there are limited number of publicly available datasets and some datasets require training and approval so for the purpose of this

hospital by using predictive models a supervised learning approach for 3 class classification problem will be applied to identify the patients of target classes are the patients readmitted before 30 days class 0 after 30 days class 1 or did not admit at all class 2 after discharge from hospital the logistic regression lr decision tree dt and random forest rf algorithms will be used to fit the relationship we will also evaluate the performance among the algorithms to pick best one python scikit learn machine learning library pandas dataframe will be utilized to build the models introduction when a patient is admitted again into a hospital within a certain interval of time after discharge from hospital is called hospital readmission it is very important as hospital readmission rate can be a major indicator of patient s health and life hospital quality and cost of treatment for example if a patient was never been re admitted it s a very good sign whereas if the patient is re admitted within the 30 days of discharge represents a possibility of inappropriate treatment on the other hand getting readmitted after 30 days can indicate both the quality of treatment given and or the state of the patient the complex relationship between readmission and potential risk factors makes readmission prediction a difficult task however it is very important to know which patients are more vulnerable for readmissions because it helps to reduce of admission rate it has been argued that up to two thirds of the readmissions are preventable therefore advances in patient readmission prediction are worth the investment 3 4 readmission prediction has been tackled with diverse statistical approaches 5 6 such as logistic regression 7 8 and survival analysis 9 each day hospital produce enormous amount of data around the world and now a day data science has ability to deal with these massive data set due to improvement of computing power and technology which facilitated to apply different prediction models to get results rapidly and efficiently recently huge attention has been given to reduce hospital readmission rate using predictive machine learning approaches such as a binary classification problem 8 10 support vector machines svm 4 11 12 deep learning 13 14 artificial neural network 7 and naïve bayes 5 15 despite this long history of studies about hospital readmission for adult patients such as for stoke 7 emergency patients 8 9 10 heart failure 5 11 pediatric patients 2 15 there are a few studies devoted to readmission of diabetic patients 1 12 16 although diabetics patients have more tendency to readmit in the hospital which is around 9 3 of the total patients in us and 28 of which are undiagnosed 17 18 svm and a very small amount of data has been used in 12 16 for analysis but for large dataset svm is bad choice as it is computationally expensive other work 1 was paid attention was the importance of a specific feature hba1c in this project we will use 10 years diabetic data sets to model the patients who are most likely to readmit to hospital our tools will facilitate the identification of patients potentially at high risk to reduce readmission rate so that resources can be used more efficiently in terms of cost benefit details of data set and methods have been described in the material and methods section in the result and discussion we explain performance of each model for both balance and imbalance data set after that a short conclusion and future work will be presented last section will be references materials and methods data description a 10 years of clinical care diabetic dataset over the period between 1999 to 2008 throughout 130 usa hospitals has been used in this project it was collected by the health facts database cerner corporation kansas city mo as the actual data is gathered by integrated delivery network health systems so it includes all patient s information so for specific interest it was required to extract new dataset from the database following some specific criteria it will not be done in this project as our data source already done it there are 101766 encounters with total feature 50 containing both numerical and categorical in types we have three target class the patients readmitted before 30 days class 0 after 30 days class 1 or did not admit at all class 2 after discharge from hospital details of dataset can be found in 1 and available in online https www hindawi com journals bmri 2014 781670 as a supplementary material and uci machine learning repository https archive ics uci edu ml datasets diabetes 130 us hospitals for years 1999 2008 data preprocessing the database contains missing value irrelevant and noisy information which is normal in any real world data therefore all the features and encounters will be used to make model the identifier feathers such as encounter_id and patient_nbr will be avoided we have put a 30 threshold of missing value so any features having more than 30 missing values will not be escaped from feature list features having more than 30 missing values have been filled with 0 the features weight 97 payer code 40 and medical specialty 47 were removed since it had a high percentage of missing values some features examide citoglipton and glimepiride pioglitazone have only one value as constant value does not contribute to predict anything so we avoided those features also in our dataset some patients were transferred to another unit or department in same hospital and so they were encountered several times although their patient_nbr remain same thus multiple inpatient visitors from our dataset will not be considered to follow statistically independence of the data therefore only first encounter per patient will be kept additionally we have removed all encounters are either expired or discharge to a hospice to avoid biasing our analysis finally we will have 69973 encounters with 42 features as we already mentioned that we have some features having values in text so we have encoded those categorical data to numerical data we have also found that frequency of the values some features are just 1 or small and we used binning to reduce those noise from features our data has been scaled by standardization scaling as the dataset is imbalanced thus oversampling technique has been applied to make data balanced technologies and algorithms the language for this project would be python and the most widely used flexible and user friendly scikit learn machine learning library and pandas dataframe will be utilized to build the models the logistic regression lr decision tree dt and random forest rf algorithms will be used for prediction as dataset of this project fits the memory adequately so we go for scikit learn library instead of spark or dask framework lr dt and rdf are the best choice in data science community which inspired us to pick those three svm is also accurate but it is very expensive computationally and additionally svm has a poor performance with imbalanced dataset due to its soft margin optimization problem results and discussion dataset have been split in to 70 to train the models and 30 to evaluate model performance the results from both balanced and imbalanced datasets will be present and explained the hyperparameters of models have been calculated using k fold cross validation process where k is selected as 5 same parameters for individual model are used for both cases to measure model performance we apply 6 types of metrics best_cv_score mean_cv_score accuracy_score recall_score precision_score and f1_score we have also used confusion matrix cm to analysis class wise accuracy imbalanced data table 1 shows the accuracy from k fold cross validation of the models first and second rows are the score form the best parameters and mean accuracy among 5 folds respectively for both dt and rdf k fold suggested max_depth 10 table 2 represents training and test accuracy of the models it seems that all the models have an average performance and no significant difference are observed among the models these three figures represent confusion matrix of test dataset when max_depth depth is 10 we observe that all the model performs poorly for class 0 even in rdf there is no prediction for class 0 we also see a slightly better prediction for class 1 compare to class 0 which tells us that the overall accuracy mostly depends on class 2 so it is clearly due to imbalanced dataset because the results are biased on class 2 in our datasets the ratio between class 0 class 1 class 2 is 1 0 3 4 6 6 data resample may apply to improve the performance as both dt and rdf support data resampling before making data resampling we have made a try first to change max_depth from 10 to 30 for dt and rdf to see if it can help to improve our model accuracy these are figures are showing confusion matrix for dt and rdf with max_depth 30 it seems increasing max_depth did not help at too much however the accuracy table gives the interesting information where training accuracy are really promising which are above 95 in both dt and rdf model on the other hand test performance is still disappointing this information suggests us that the results are overfitting we can avoid overfitting by adding more data into dataset or by adding regularization term in the model thus in both cases imbalanced and overfitting data resample can be applied to overcome the problems balanced data our second approach is resampling dataset we use upscale resampling technique as it is straight forward to make data balanced after resampling our current ratio is class 0 class 1 class 2 0 9 0 9 1 0 after analyzing both table and confusion matrix it suggests that resampling is giving us mixed results for logistic regression model it seems performance went downward which around 42 in all the metrics on the other hand decision tree has made satisfactory progress 77 but seems still have reasonable overfitting issue but can be resolve by regularization or by using other resampling techniques however random forest is showing very encouraging outcome and has also handled those two issues adequately random forest has scored over 85 of accuracy and therefore it can be the best choice to select model to predict the patient s class conclusion and future work readmission rate is an indicator of patient s health and life hospital quality and cost of treatment in this project we started our journey with 10 years of diabetic clinical dataset to identify who are the most likely to readmit after discharge from hospital we have used a supervised learning approach for 3 class classification problem and applied logistic regression lr decision tree dt and random forest rdf classifiers as prediction models we have taken care of over 100k samples with 50 features we have avoided some of the features and samples which were irrelevant to make our prediction model we have also encoded categorical features bucketed rescaled and resampled of our dataset the model performance for individual patient s class was not satisfactory due to imbalanced dataset and resampling technique was applied to make dataset balanced after analyzing all the accuracy tables and confusion matrix among the models random forest would be the best choice to select model to predict the patient s class we have used data duplication technique for oversampling but can be applied more standard and reliable techniques such as smote although there was no computational difficulty to run the model due to our data size but can be extended to cluster and parallel computing framework such as apache and dask for faster processing when data size will grow bigger we will also apply more accurate and updated algorithm such as deep learning and artificial neural network acknowledgment thanks to professor for his advice and comments both the class and online about the

the cost is attributed to the type 2 version of diabetes which is typically diagnosed in middle age today is december 31 2016 a commercial health insurance company has contracted you to predict which of their members are most likely to be newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2017 your goal is to featurize their data train and optimize a predictive model and explain your results and approach note newly diagnosed means members who were not previously coded with diabetes prior to 2016 12 31 inclusive problem statement your goal is to featurize the insurance claims data and train and optimize a predictive model to find the risk of diabetes in patients data source the dataset was provided by lumiata company which deals with healthcare insurance claims technologies python 3 6 7 type of data the data provided are real patient claims records from a large insurance company appropriately de identified the data sets have already been split into training and test sets train txt test txt train 70 test 30 each line in both text files is a patient record represented as a json string the health record is parameterized by a set of encounter dates in a yyyy mm dd format the structure of each patient json is as follows bday patient date of birth in yyyy mm dd format is_male true male false female patient_id de identified patient id each patient is given a unique value resources dictionary of encounter_date list of codes described below observations dictionary of encounter_date list of dictionaries described below tag_dm2 indicates date of first type 2 diabetes diagnosis will either have a yyyy mm dd date or be an empty string this information will be censored from the holdout set described above split indicates a member is in the train or test set information beyond 2017 01 01 has been removed from test txt each patient record has a key tag_dm2 whose value is either a yyyy mm dd date string indicating the date of first code of a diagnosis of diabetes or an empty string indicating no diabetes in their record you should cohort your data i e construct the response variable in the training set according to the following definitions check your work with the training set counts given below for each definition a claim is someone whose tag_dm2 date is between 2017 01 01 and 2017 12 31 inclusive training set count of claim 3410 the response for these members is a 1 a never claim is someone whose tag_dm2 date is either after 2017 12 31 exclusive or is an empty string training set count of never claim 70110 the response for these members is a 0 a prior is someone whose tag_dm2 date is before 2017 01 01 exclusive typically priors are filtered out of the matrix before training you may include these people in training but keep in mind they will be filtered out of test when we evaluate your solution each patient record also has two keys describing their health history resources observations the resources key specifies the diagnoses medications and procedures that were noted prescribed performed at each doctor s visit these are represented by different coding systems icd9 10 rxnorm cpt respectively each encounter date in the resources key is mapped to the corresponding list of codes issued at that doctor s visit the codes have the format _ for instance icd9_272 0 which corresponds to high cholesterol http www icd9data com 2015 volume1 240 279 270 279 272 272 0 htm note encounter dates in resources can sometimes have no codes in the code list the observations key specifies the lab tests that were completed each encounter date is mapped to a list of dictionaries each of which has the following keys code the loinc code corresponding to the lab test interpretation whether the lab was h for high l for low n for normal or a for abnormal value the value extracted from the lab for instance the lab could have been a blood glucose test loinc_2345 7 whose value may have been 130 and hence whose interpretation would be h a cut off for high blood glucose is 106 https s details loinc org loinc 2345 7 html sections comprehensive note the values in the interpretation and value keys can sometimes be none the keys in the resources and observation dictionary correspond to the encounter date with the doctor all dates are formatted as string in yyyy mm dd format e g 2016 04 30 the format of the file you submit to us should be a csv file formatted as your_name_here _dm2_solution csv we should be able to read in your solution using pandas as follows data pre processing stratified sampling to obtain a balanced dataset converting the complicated json file to a dataframe algorithms implemented logistic regression support vector classifier svc steps involved step 1 since it was a highly unbalanced data balancing the dataset using stratified sampling technique i have taken the demographic age variable while using this technique step 2 analyzed the icd9 codes cpt codes and resource codes and found out which variables contribute to chronic diabetes step 3 removed some of the variables based on the number of unique values and created final dataframe from the complex json file step 4 ran statistical tests to find the significant variables in the final dataframe step 5 after finding the most significant variables ran svc on the final variables and calculated the porbability of diabetes in each patient evaluation metrics rmse root mean square error results and conclusion by analyzing our dataset we tried to find the probability of diabetes in each patient by considering their past medical tests and conditions the results of the support vector classifier svc are shown below ,https://github.com/ankitbvs,"Updated Sep 30, 2020"

designed implemented tested and presented it also describes the high level requirements of the stakeholders based on their needs and expectations i e the desired product features 2 project scope the project aim is to develop the sacchon app and deliver it ready to be released the requirements are given by the sacchon consulting enterprise a fictional company the information system must contain a user interface to submit and view medical data by the patients and doctors an administration console with user management monitoring and reporting capabilities of the system usage for the above features to be considered complete the following functionality must be provided from the backend view a corresponding call with a valid json object containing all needed information must be available according to the specification of each case from the frontend view a corresponding page consuming the service from the backend and presenting the suitable information must be available 3 deliverables the deliverable of this project is the integrated platform of the back and the front system of the sacchon this means that the following three subsystems must be delivered medidatarepo the repository of medical data doctoradvice the doctor advice services system reporter the reporting services in the following sections all needed functionality for each subsystem is defined 4 functional requirements 4 1 overview the patient uses the system to store their data at any time after a month of data recording has elapsed a doctor can review this data and provide advice to the patient for the next month this process is repeated until the patient or the doctor unregisters from the system the chief doctor is an officer who can view reports which monitor the activity of patients and doctors in the system the following sections list the functionality needed to be present for the system to be considered complete 4 2 medidatarepo the patient can manage their account sign up for an account remove the account store their data blood glucose level date time measured in mg dl carb intake measured in grams view their average daily blood glucose level over a user specified period their average carb intake over a user specified period the current and past consultations from doctors update modify incorrect submitted data delete incorrect submitted data 4 3 doctoradvice the doctor can manage their account sign up for an account remove the account view patient record browse the data for a single patient patient data and consultations search find patients that have not had a consultation in the last month consult provide advice to a patient for the upcoming month name of medication and dosage update modify a consultation to a patient initially a patient has not doctor consulting them as soon as a month of data recording has passed the patient is ready to be consulted by a doctor doctors search for patients for which advice is pending each doctor can see all the patients that they consult and the patients that are new in the system doctors cannot see patients that are consulted by other doctors all doctors can see the new patients when a doctor selects to consult a new patient the patient becomes managed by this doctor exclusively when a doctor leaves the system their patients become available again for other doctors to consult past consultations of these patients continue to refer to the doctor who is leaving the system if a doctor modifies a consultation the patient must see a warning as soon as they enter the system so that they know that some important information must be reviewed a month is the period from the day of consultation to the same date next month say from the 15th of june to the 14th of july it is not a calendar month the next month for a patient starts as soon as a doctor has provided a consultation until the new consultation arrives the previous one is considered valid 4 4 reporter this section is available only to the chief doctors in the application the reports available are the information submissions personal monitor data of a patient over a time range the information submissions consultations of a doctor over a time range the list of the patients who are waiting for a consultation and the time elapsed since they needed to have one the list of the patients with no activity over a time range the list of the doctors with no activity over a time range 5 non functional requirements 5 1 sacchon app the sacchon app must be able to run in any current major web browser performance to guarantee a good user experience all calls to the backend must have a maximum response time of 1 second excluding network response time version control all code must make use of the git version control system each team must create its own single github code repository user interface a basic ui design with open source images will be used 5 2 sacchon application code development environment the following set up is required the backend part of the system must be developed in java 8 or greater any ide can be used for the implementation jetbrains intellij idea is preferred but not required the frontend will be developed using the angular framework the underlying database system must be the microsoft sql server developer edition maven must be the tool to manage dependencies and the software development lifecycle software interfaces all functionality must be implemented by using http calls returning information in json format a software interface document must be created this is to be read by external software developers who may want to interface with the system the document must provide the following information give the list of communications including the description of the data that is being exchanged specify any constraints describe application or other software interface characteristics including component names and versions databases operating systems libraries tools etc that must be known to the developers testing the system must be fully backed up by unit tests for testing the rest calls a third party tool should be utilized postman https www getpostman com is recommended as a commonly used tool in this area swagger can also interface with the deliverable for testing automating rest calls testing is highly recommended logging a well defined logging policy maintaining all information produced by the software when running is mandatory the logging policy must be documented e g name the specific log files directories the rotation policy etc exception handling when handling software exceptions every call must be guaranteed to return a valid json document this includes the cases where something went wrong in the backend execution due to either development bugs or system causes the end user must never see default error pages on the web browser depending on the type of the call the various crud actions the proper http code must be always returned from the backend for further processing up front deliverables the application code must be delivered in a single project repository on github on the master branch of the project the required

groundbreaking diabetes drug that is ready for phase iii clinical trial testing it is a very unique and sensitive drug that requires administering and screening the drug over at least 5 7 days of time in the hospital with frequent monitoring testing and patient medication adherence training with a mobile application you have been provided a patient dataset from a client partner and are tasked with building a predictive model that can identify which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on target patients are people that are likely to be in the hospital for this duration of time and will not incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring in order to achieve your goal you must build a regression model that can predict the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and use this to select filter patients for your study expected hospitalization time regression model utilizing a synthetic dataset denormalized at the line level augmentation built off of the uci diabetes readmission dataset students will build a regression model that predicts the expected days of hospitalization time and then convert this to a binary prediction of whether to include or exclude that patient from the clinical trial this project will demonstrate the importance of building the right data representation at the encounter level with appropriate filtering and preprocessing feature engineering of key medical code sets this project will also require students to analyze and interpret their model for biases across key demographic groups dataset due to healthcare phi regulations hipaa hitech there are limited number of publicly available datasets and some datasets require training and approval so for the purpose of this

if it is present then following can be done imputing data using imputation method in sklearn filling nan values with mean median and mode using fillna method describe data which can give statistical analysis mainly work on the data set and do some transformation like creating different bins of particular columns clean the messy data so that it can be used in our ml model this step is very important because for a high prediction score you need to continuously make changes in it do some eda analysis data visualisation to understand the relationship between different independent variables and the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variables prepare categorical variables for model using label encoder convert categorical text data into model understandable numerical data divide the data set into test and train all our data is numerical after label encoding so we split the data into test and train predict the price with our test data set building model measure the performance of a better and more tuned algorithm using different classifier technique and comparing them to see which algorithm is giving better performance evaluated various models for computing expected future prices and classifying whether this is the best time to buy the ticket finally after the above steps predict the air tickets prices and the performance of the models is

enterprise a fictional company the information system must contain a user interface to submit and view medical data by the patients and doctors an administration console with user management monitoring and reporting capabilities of the system usage for the above features to be considered complete the following functionality must be provided from the backend view a corresponding call with a valid json object containing all needed information must be available according to the specification of each case from the frontend view a corresponding page consuming the service from the backend and presenting the suitable information must be available overview the patient uses the system to store their data at any time after a month of data recording has elapsed a doctor can review this data and provide advice to the patient for the next month this process is repeated until the patient or the doctor unregisters from the system the chief doctor is an officer who can view reports which monitor the activity of patients and doctors in the system functionallity of user roles medidatarepo the patient can manage their account sign up for an account remove the account store their data blood glucose level date time measured in mg dl carb intake measured in grams view their average daily blood glucose level over a user specified period their average carb intake over a user specified period the current and past consultations from doctors update modify incorrect submitted data delete incorrect submitted data doctor advice the doctor can manage their account sign up for an account remove the account view patient record browse the data for a single patient patients data and consultations search find patients that have not had a consultation in the last month consult provide advice to a patient for the upcoming month name of medication and dosage update modify a consultation to a patient reporter this section is available only to the chief doctors in the application the reports available are the information submissions personal monitor data of a patient over a time range the information submissions consultations of a doctor over a time range the list of the patients who are waiting for a consultation and the time elapsed since they needed to have one the list of the patients with no activity over a timerange the list of the doctors with no activity over a time range the user story of the application initially a patient has not doctor consulting them as soon as a month of data recording has passed the patient is ready to be consulted by a doctor doctors search for patients for which advice is pending each doctor can see all the patients that they consult and the patients that are new in the system doctors cannot see patients that are consulted by other doctors all doctors can see the new patients when a doctor selects to consult a new patient the patient becomes managed by this doctor exclusively when a doctor leaves the system their patients become available again for other doctors to consult past consultations of these patients continue to refer to the doctor who is leaving the system if a doctor modifies a consultation the patient must see a warning as soon as they enter the system so that they know that some important information must be reviewed a month is the period from the day of consultation to the same date next month say from the 15th of june to the 14th of july it is not a calendar month the next month for a patient starts as soon as a doctor has provided a consultation until the new consultation arrives the previous

abstract the final deliverable in the software engineering bootcamp is the group project software sacchon a diabetes management web application each team will create their own implementation based on a software requirements specification srs document the srs is common to all but each team can follow their own assumptions and approaches sacchon is divided into two distinct subsystems the sacchon rest api which is the backend and the sacchon angular app which is the frontend to the end user the web app consists of three major components the repository of medical data medidatarepo the doctor advice services system doctoradvice and the reporting services reporter medidatarepo keeps track of the users blood glucose level daily consumed carbohydrates and medication intake in the doctoradvice section a team of doctors provide advice to patients on a per call basis reporter provides a series of aggregation operations for creating tables and charts further details on the business requirements of each component will be discussed in the class table of contents 1 introduction 2 project scope 3 deliverables 4 functional requirements 4 1 overview 4 2 medidatarepo 4 3 doctoradvice 4

designed implemented tested and presented it also describes the high level requirements of the stakeholders based on their needs and expectations i e the desired product features 2 project scope the project aim is to develop the sacchon app and deliver it ready to be released the requirements are given by the sacchon consulting enterprise a fictional company the information system must contain a user interface to submit and view medical data by the patients and doctors an administration console with user management monitoring and reporting capabilities of the system usage for the above features to be considered complete the following functionality must be provided from the backend view a corresponding call with a valid json object containing all needed information must be available according to the specification of each case from the frontend view a corresponding page consuming the service from the backend and presenting the suitable information must be available 3 deliverables the deliverable of this project is the integrated platform of the back and the front system of the sacchon this means that the following three subsystems must be delivered medidatarepo the repository of medical data doctoradvice the doctor advice services system reporter the reporting services in the following sections all needed functionality for each subsystem is defined 4 functional requirements 4 1 overview the patient uses the system to store their data at any time after a month of data recording has elapsed a doctor can review this data and provide advice to the patient for the next month this process is repeated until the patient or the doctor unregisters from the system the chief doctor is an officer who can view reports which monitor the activity of patients and doctors in the system the following sections list the functionality needed to be present for the system to be considered complete 4 2 medidatarepo the patient can manage their account sign up for an account remove the account store their data blood glucose level date time measured in mg dl carb intake measured in grams view their average daily blood glucose level over a user specified period their average carb intake over a user specified period the current and past consultations from doctors update modify incorrect submitted data delete incorrect submitted data 4 3 doctoradvice the doctor can manage their account sign up for an account remove the account view patient record browse the data for a single patient patient data and consultations search find patients that have not had a consultation in the last month consult provide advice to a patient for the upcoming month name of medication and dosage update modify a consultation to a patient initially a patient has not doctor consulting them as soon as a month of data recording has passed the patient is ready to be consulted by a doctor doctors search for patients for which advice is pending each doctor can see all the patients that they consult and the patients that are new in the system doctors cannot see patients that are consulted by other doctors all doctors can see the new patients when a doctor selects to consult a new patient the patient becomes managed by this doctor exclusively when a doctor leaves the system their patients become available again for other doctors to consult past consultations of these patients continue to refer to the doctor who is leaving the system if a doctor modifies a consultation the patient must see a warning as soon as they enter the system so that they know that some important information must be reviewed a month is the period from the day of consultation to the same date next month say from the 15th of june to the 14th of july it is not a calendar month the next month for a patient starts as soon as a doctor has provided a consultation until the new consultation arrives the previous one is considered valid 4 4 reporter this section is available only to the chief doctors in the application the reports available are the information submissions personal monitor data of a patient over a time range the information submissions consultations of a doctor over a time range the list of the patients who are waiting for a consultation and the time elapsed since they needed to have one the list of the patients with no activity over a time range the list of the doctors with no activity over a time range 5 non functional requirements 5 1 sacchon app the sacchon app must be able to run in any current major web browser performance to guarantee a good user experience all calls to the backend must have a maximum response time of 1 second excluding network response time version control all code must make use of the git version control system each team must create its own single github code repository user interface a basic ui design with open source images will be used 5 2 sacchon application code development environment the following set up is required the backend part of the system must be developed in java 8 or greater any ide can be used for the implementation jetbrains intellij idea is preferred but not required the frontend will be developed using the angular framework the underlying database system must be the microsoft sql server developer edition maven must be the tool to manage dependencies and the software development lifecycle software interfaces all functionality must be implemented by using http calls returning information in json format a software interface document must be created this is to be read by external software developers who may want to interface with the system the document must provide the following information give the list of communications including the description of the data that is being exchanged specify any constraints describe application or other software interface characteristics including component names and versions databases operating systems libraries tools etc that must be known to the developers testing the system must be fully backed up by unit tests for testing the rest calls a third party tool should be utilized postman https www getpostman com is recommended as a commonly used tool in this area swagger can also interface with the deliverable for testing automating rest calls testing is highly recommended logging a well defined logging policy maintaining all information produced by the software when running is mandatory the logging policy must be documented e g name the specific log files directories the rotation policy etc exception handling when handling software exceptions every call must be guaranteed to return a valid json document this includes the cases where something went wrong in the backend execution due to either development bugs or system causes the end user must never see default error pages on the web browser depending on the type of the call the various crud actions the proper http code must be always returned from the backend for further processing up front deliverables the application code must be delivered in a single project repository on github on the master branch of the project the required software interface document must be included as project documentation in the same repository ,https://github.com/atsianis,Jupyter Notebook

VIT Vellore,10,5,192,108, fecare with an intention of fekar care in hindi towards the health of indian women web app link to view demo scroll to the end researchers have identified a bunch of districts in india that have a maximum prevalence of diabetes among women at least 50 of the 640 districts studied have a high prevalence of diabetes greater than one in every 10 among women and hence fecare classifier model aims to detect diabetes in indian women the clasifier was trained using pima indians diabetes dataset dataset info the dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable outcome predictor variables include number of times pregnant plasma glucose concentration 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test not included in training diastolic blood pressure mm hg triceps skinfold thickness mm 2 hour serum insulin mu u ml not included in training body mass index diabetes pedigree function age years as you can notice that two variables were not included in the training process this was due to the reason that the glucose tolerance test gtg can give very inaccurate results when conducted at home using a blood sugar measuring device and same is the case for finding the reading of 2 hour serum insulin as this project aims to provide regular diabetes check up for all women above the age of 20 years irrespective of their work engagement house wives and working women it is not possible in all cases that user will have the required tools skills and experience to execute the required test at home and hence the above features were eliminated from the training process requirements the user should know her general information age height weight and pregnancies to know the reading of diastolic blood pressure the user should have a blood pressure monitor like this which costs less than 100 to know the tricep skinfold thickness value the user should have a skinfold caliper and take the reading in the following manner the cost of skinfold caliper is less than 4 if the user do not know her diabetes pedigree function then it can be calculated on the web application using the following reference the user can input relative s details as much she knows in the web application and diabetes pedigree function will be calculated note that the value of the dpf increases as the number of relatives who developed dm increases as the age at which those relatives developed dm decreases and as the percentage of genes that they share with the subject increases also notice that the value of the dpf decreases as the number of relatives who never developed dm increases as their ages at their last examinain increase and as the percent of genes that they share with the subject increases steps for pre processing data and training classifier the data has a very less number of 1s in output cases with positive diabetes and hence this can affect the classifier s accuracy to differentiate with 1s and 0s due to this reason almost equal amount of data for 1s and 0s were taken in the training set for which the data was divided into two parts on the same basis and then segregated for training data now the two data frames with 1s and 0s were concatenated so that they can be accessed easily fixing missing values zeros in all other variables except pregnancies missing values in glucose 5 missing values in bloodpressure 35 missing values in skinthickness 227 missing values in insulin 374 missing values in bmi 11 missing values in diabetespedigreefunction 0 missing values in age 0 these values were fixed using the following algorithm let s say a data frame has 3 variables as shown below the missing value is 1st value in var1 now the 1st values of var2 and var3 are noted which are 500 and 0 35 respectively now we try to find similar values 500 0 35 in var2 and var3 which in this case are 3rd value in var2 and 0th value in var3 the missing value is then replaced by the average of var1 values at these positions 3rd and 0th in this case 89 81 2 85 var1 1 code the above algorithm is used to fix missing values in the following way glucose values from similar age and outcome values fix_miss_value data glucose age outcome bloodpressure values from similar age and glucose values bmi values from similar age bloodpressure and glucose values skinthickness values from similar age outcome glucose bmi values the rest variables used in training age and diabetespedigreefunction had no missing values scaling us the diabetespedigreefunction values these values were less than 1 while the other values were greater than 1 and hence these values were multiplied by 100 splitting data into training and testing set for training data 300 entries with 0 outcome and 250 values with 1 outcome were taken this collectively was 71 of the total data now the training data was ready the remaining 29 of data was further split into the 13 testing and 13 validation dataset neural network definition

India,3,63,28,704, diabetes drug testing context you are a data scientist for an exciting unicorn healthcare startup that has created a groundbreaking diabetes drug that is ready for phase iii clinical trial testing it is a very unique and sensitive drug that requires administering and screening the drug over at least 5 7 days of time in the hospital with frequent monitoring testing and patient medication adherence training with a mobile application you have been provided a patient dataset from a client partner and are tasked with building a predictive model that can identify which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on target patients are people that are likely to be in the hospital for this duration of time and will not incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring in order to achieve your goal you must build a regression model that can predict the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and use this to select filter patients for your study expected hospitalization time regression model utilizing a synthetic dataset denormalized at the line level augmentation built off of the uci diabetes readmission dataset students will build a regression model that predicts the expected days of hospitalization time and then convert this to a binary prediction of whether to include or exclude that patient from the clinical trial this project will demonstrate the importance of building the right data representation at the encounter level with appropriate filtering and preprocessing feature engineering of key medical code sets this project will also require students to analyze and interpret their model for biases across key demographic groups dataset due to healthcare phi regulations hipaa hitech there are limited number of publicly available datasets and some datasets require training and approval so for the purpose of this exercise we are using a dataset from uc

"Boston, MA",1,0,0,108, disease prediction with nhanes this project utilizes the national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes to predict people s likelihood of getting six medical conditions including depression fracture risk hypertension high cholesterol diabetes and oral issues 1 results highlight the grouped model correctly predicts 56 3 of the people in the validation set with their most likely health conditions the optimal models for each disease all achieve precisions higher than the prevalence rate which means they work better than random guessings the models have a particularly strong predictive power for fracture risk hypertension and high cholesterol 2 why this project matters 1 making predictions with limited information predicting disease is tricky for two reasons a solid domain knowledge in medical science is required and b health data is sensitive to collect and protected by law however knowing the customer well is critical for businesses to make sound marketing and strategic decisions therefore this research tries to solve the problem by predicting health conditions with limited and non sensitive information that people feel comfortable providing 2 utilizing nhanes data to build the models nhanes is trustworthy regularly updated and publicly available for free more details will be discussed in the next chapter this project aims to facilitate decision makings for marketing and sales professionals also since the dataset is free the project is friendly to businesses with a limited budget on the contrary the project is not trying to replace doctors and medical equipment at hospitals this difference is critical to remember when evaluating model performances 3 about nhanes national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes is a systematic program of studies designed by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc to assess people s health and nutritional status in the u s it includes both interviews and physical examinations of the interviewees the survey updates every two years for details about nhanes please click here 4 data cleaning nhanes 2013 2014 data is selected for this project because it includes reasonably comprehensive information than more recent surveys recent data is still under process nhanes stores the raw data in different files based on category this project uses mysql to clean and manipulate the data missing data is a great challenge for data cleaning data are missed for three reasons refused don t know or does not apply n a this project uses grouping average to replace the missing values common grouping factors are age gender race and education please refer to the sql script for details since nhanes records limited information for people under 20 years old who are also less likely to suffer from the health conditions of concern this research only studies people equal to or older than 20 5 769 observations are included in the final dataset 5 variable selection and visualization 5 1 selecting xs four factors are considered for variable selection 1 the relevance of the data with the diseases 2 sensitiveness of the data 3 availability of the data 4 total numbers

nutrition_info would use restaurant nutrition info 24 poverty_level_category family poverty level index categories deleted eventually initially the project uses pca to reduce data dimensions but this approach is not chosen because it makes interpretation difficult instead the variables are selected based on knowledge in medical science and economics 5 2 obtaining y the medical conditions collecting diagnoses from the nhanes dataset may be trickier than people thought for example only comparing blood pressure value at physical examinations may generate biased hypertension diagnoses because patients take medicine to lower the pressure also since the project is designed for business practitioners not doctors the conditions thresholds have been relaxed people near the threshold may be classified as patients such aggressive classification may help businesses provide disease prevention services finally the prevalence rates are calculated based on the nhanes 2013 2014 dataset that is the number of identified patients over sample size the benchmarks used to define diagnoses are summarized below note if a condition have multiple criteria people will be considered as patient if at least one criterion is meet condition criteria related variable from nhanes 1 depression prevalence rate 0 22 over the last 2 weeks feeling down depressed or hopeless for at least several days dpq020

diseases concerned a depression versus health condition self evaluation plot 2 a and 1 b shows people with a worse self awared health condition are more likely to get depressed b fracture risk versus age plot 2 a and 2 b shows fracture risk increases with age c hypertension versus education level plot 3 a and 3 b shows hypertension is less frequently seen in higher educated populations and a college degree makes a significant difference d 1 high cholesterol versus smoking now plot 4 a and 4 b shows smoking people are less likely to get high cholesterol weird another version of the story people quit smoking after diagnosed with high cholesterol now check the demographic structure of smoking population plot 4 c and 4 d based on the data people tend to quit smoking after 60 or people who frequently smoke are less likely to reach senior age whichever hypothesis is correct smoking now is not an excellent factor to predict high cholesterol d 2 high cholesterol versus smoking_100 now switch to another variable smoking_100 which shows whether the person has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in life the plots are shown in 4 e and 4 f based on the data people with a smoking history are slightly more likely to get high cholesterol than non smokers making more sense e diabetes versus family history diabetes as shown in 5 a and 5 b people with a family history of diabetes are three times more likely to get diabetes than those without a family history or history unknown f oral health versus poverty level based on 6 a and 6 b people with better financial conditions suffer less from oral health problems however the poverty level is not available in real life people unwilling to provide or even illegal to ask therefore this project uses monthly restaurant expenditure as a proxy 6 modeling 6 1 training the optimal model for each condition eight candidate models are applied tuned and compared for each of the six medical conditions of concern the eight candidate models include 1 ridge logistic 2 lasso logistic 3 k nearest neighbors knn 4 naive bayes 5 support vector machine svm 6 decision tree 7 random forest 8 neural network the optimal models and their summaries

designed to facilitate business decisions not medical diagnosis precision is a slightly more important factor than recall quick recap table factor meaning precision among all the people who predicted to be ill how many of them are actually ill recall among all the people who are actually ill how many of them are correctly predicted as ill f1 score a weighted average of the precision and recall 6 2 grouping the models to derive probability matrix predicting whether someone has one or more of the six medical conditions is not the end of this project marketing practitioners may care more about the most likely issues versus other diseases because over sending marketing materials could be annoying and even backfire the campaign therefore the final step is to group the optimal model of each health condition and generates the likelihood matrix an example may help you understand this process better assume there are three people jack lily and sam the table below listed their likelihood of getting certain medical conditions and the last column shows the model recommendation name depression high fracture risk hypertension high cholesterol diabetes oral health predicted most likely condition jack 9 42 83 69 37 40 hypertension lily 18 23 42 54 37 69 oral health sam 39 21 16 32 27 8 depression predictions are intuitive for jack and lily jack s most likely condition is hypertension 83 and lily s most likely situation is oral health 69 so the model selects those conditions as recommendations sam looks healthier than jack and lily and none of sam s probability goes above 50 however the model decides that depression is the most likely condition for sam even though the exact value is low 39 this decision may not make sense for doctors doctors should not ask people to take medicine when the patient is 39 likely to have the condition however the prediction is still valuable to business practitioners which will be discussed more in the final chapter 7 project evaluation the grouped model correctly predicts 56 3 of people with their most likely conditions in the unseen data but how good is 56 3 as described in chapter two this project aims to facilitate decision makings for marketing and sales professionals not to replace doctors and medical equipment in other words the project tries to make the best educated guess with limited information and the educated guess is used to promote business decisions not a diagnosis this explains why classifying sam as a potential depression patient makes sense in the previous chapter for instance companies could send sam marketing materials on depression prevention or early treatment for the same reason a 56 3 accuracy rate is satisfying especially compared with the diseases prevalence rates having said that the result may be improved with more domain expertise in medicine and including more relevant variables ,https://github.com/simon201918,"Updated Nov 3, 2020"

"Banglore, India",0,0,2,42, feature extraction for hypoglycemic events detection based on ecg using transfer learning hypoglycemia is a condition that occurs when sugar levels in the blood are low the blood glucose level is considered low when it drops below 3 3mmol l 1 hypoglycemia affects the electrophysiology of the heart hence monitoring blood glucose levels is vital for healthy subjects and crucial for patients suffering from diabetes the current study used artificial intelligence ai to extract high level features from raw electrocardiogram ecg signals to automatically detect hypoglycemic events introduction hypoglycemia is one of the most important complications of diabetes treatment 2 the pervasiveness of diabetes has reached high proportions in most parts of the world according to the world health organization who nearly 220 million people are diagnosed with diabetes epidemiologic evidence insinuates that unless preventive measures are carried out the global prevalence will continue to shoot 3 various glucose monitoring systems are available in the market to measure blood glucose concentration however such systems have many drawbacks in terms of functionality and reliability a study has been conducted to detect hypoglycemia by monitoring changes in ecg and skin conductance using sensors 4 a robust real time monitoring system utilizing continuous glucose monitoring devices cgms was developed in paper 5 however the system was not developed commercially due to low efficiency and lack of sensitivity in the detection of unrecognized hypoglycemia the main drawback of many methods that utilize deep learning is the lack of data available recent performances achieved by deep learning models in pattern recognition tasks have motivated researchers to implement techniques such as transfer learning in medical image and signal processing to overcome the problem of inadequate data in this regard deep learning models have produced accurate results in the ecg domain using recurrent neural networks rnn specifically long short term memory networks lstm 6 and convolutional neural network cnn 7 the main advantage of using deep learning is the fact that deep neural networks can identify high level features therefore eliminating the need to extract features manually utilizing this merit helps us develop robust systems that can take ecg signals as input and output glucose levels for the detection of hypoglycemia in paper 8 it was shown that a personalized medicinal approach and ai could be used to detect nocturnal hypoglycemia using a few heartbeats of raw ecg signal recorded using wearable devices for 14 consecutive days additionally the paper presents a visualization technique to identify which part of the ecg signal is associated with hypoglycemia events the study proposed in this paper aims at developing a method to extracts high level features from ecg excerpts for the automatic detection of low levels of glucose in practical settings to the best of the author s knowledge the proposed study is a novel approach providing reliable results and overcoming the limitations of the lack of data available by incorporating transfer learning from the 2 dimensional domain the image classification and object detection domains consist of immense amounts of data in contrast to the ecg signal domain when the amount of data available are significantly small these domains contain enough data to train and classify images and find high level feature maps that can represent complex image patterns the features that are learnt from such classifiers can be transferred to the ecg domain if the 1 d ecg signal is transformed into a 2 d spectrogram 9 background the challenge of hypoglycemia detection the most prevalent method for glucose level detection in the blood is consist of analyzing blood droplets resulted from a finger prick however this method does not monitor glucose levels continuously moreover this method is cumbersome expensive and inaccurate as an alternative cgms are used to monitor glucose levels continuously based on glucose in the interstitial fluid while these devices provide relatively accurate results they are highly expensive and unattractive for pre diabetic patients moreover most cgms require finger prick calibration which is not very reliable the details that need to be analyzed in an ecg signal are fine grained and identical therefore have patterns that are hard to detect this problem could be solved with the availability of large datasets however the datasets existing in the ecg domain contain a small amount of data when a small amount of data is used for training the model is susceptible to overfitting and may fail to generalize and detect patterns in unseen data therefore the amount of data available validation accuracy and reliability of hypoglycemic events on unseen data propose a challenge in training a deep neural network however for the same reasons we incorporate a technique known as transfer learning and off the shelf cnn features for accurate detection of hypoglycemia on previously unseen data transfer learning knowledge learnt from a pattern in one domain is transferable to another domain the transfer learning technique enables us to transfer this knowledge from one domain to another and used in the latter domain for classification a deep cnn is used for automatic feature extraction the layers inside the network consist of feature maps that are learnt during the training on the original dataset moreover these feature maps hold information regarding the patterns in that dataset these feature maps can be used to extract feature in another dataset these off the shelf features are strong enough to extract features in another domain 10 in this study we incorporate a deep neural network densenet that learn from millions of images via the imagenet dataset the knowledge learnt from this large dataset is transferred to the ecg domain and is used for feature extraction consequently these high level features can be used to detect hypoglycemic events densenet a densenet is a deep feed forward neural network in which each layer is connected to every other layer 11 this type of model architecture helps reduce the problem of vanishing gradient the state of the art densenet model performs highly accurate object detection tasks the densenet consists of 4 dense blocks of variable length in our study we incorporate a pre trained densenet which has 161 convolutional layers and analyze the output of these layers for feature extraction methodology method overview to detect hypoglycemic events using ecg excerpts we first cut the ecg signal recordings based on the glucose levels recorded by cgms our model was evaluated on 5 minutes ecg excerpts the first 200 beats in the given excerpt were considered as input to the densenet this is considered as one data instance each instance of data is transformed into an image using spectrograms these images are fed into the densenet model and high level features are extracted by analyzing the output of 12 convolutional layers dataset the dataset used in our study is extracted from the open d1namo dataset 12 the dataset was acquired on 20 healthy subjects and 9 subjects diagnosed with type 1 diabetes the data is collected in a practical setting with the zephyr bioharness 3 wearable device the device can measure ecg breathing and accelerometer signals additionally the dataset contains glucose measurements and annotated food pictures the device also measures additional metrics such as hearth rate hr breathing rate br activity level posture etc the device measures ecg at a rate of 250 u202fhz and up to 54 89 u202fmv data selection ecg excerpts of 5 minutes were annotated with the help of cgm readings a glucose concentration lower than 4 mmol l is considered to be lower glucose level and a glucose concentration between 4 mmol l and 7 5 mmol l is considered normal glucose level heartbeats corresponding to the extracted ecg signals are considered for training signal transformation since we incorporate a pre trained deep neural network which is trained on images and used as a feature extractor for ecg signals every instance of data must be transformed into an image we use spectrograms to carry out this transformation spectrograms apprehend variations in the power of the signals in every image by taking the fourier transform ft of each partition of the ecg signal feature selection feature extraction is carried out by examining the output of convolutional layers inside the densenet model the extracted features are considered as feature vectors we select 12 layers and extract feature vectors from the output of each convolutional layer this is evident as each layer contains different feature maps which are activated due to unique patterns conclusion the study advances the feasibility of a real time non invasive system to detect hypoglycemia using short excerpts of ecg signals and the technique of transfer learning efforts have been made to incorporate a deep neural network pre trained on millions of images is used as a feature extractor on the ecg signals transfer learning helps us overcome the problem of the lack of data available in the ecg domain hence the features maps learnt from the imagenet dataset is powerful enough to represent the spectrograms of ecg signals these high level features can be utilized to detect low levels of glucose in the blood using a few raw ecg signals

New Jersey,18,15,17,396, readmission prediction of diabetic patients authors yung han jeong malcolm katzenbach overview this project will create classification models to predict hospital readmissions regarding patients with diabetes through data provided by virginia commonwealth university downloaded from kaggle from 1999 2008 with 130 u s hospitals predicting high risk patients will provide valuable information to the careproviders to better prepare future care needs of diabetic patients business problem determining treatment effectiveness within diabetic pateints is an ardous process therefore predicting readmission possibility of patients would allow care providers to determine treatment qaulity effectiveness and prepare further treatment plans if necessary also classifying high risk patients would determine ineffective or errorneous treatments reducing treatment risks in the future this prediction model will provide insight to treatment effecitiveness cost reduction method and reduced medical risks to careproviders hospitals and insurance angency can utilize this model to increase logistical and financial support for highly effective treatments and high risk patients data the data provided by virginia commonwealth university collected from 130 u s hospitals over the years of 1999 2008 on diabetic pateints the data is separated by unique patient id and provides features such as number of medications hospital stays and sex the readmission status was defined as no no readmission in that year 30 readmitted within 30 days of last visit and 30 readmitted after 30 days period a supporting documetion description pdf impatct of hba1c measurement on hospital readmission rates analysis of 70 000 clinical databse patient records was also provided as reference methods clean data set by creating dummy variables for categorical data diagnosis categorized per icd9 code group defined by related study refere to decription pdf page 5 table 2 dropped irrelevant or largely missing data columns such as pateint id and weight perform eda on cleaned data to gain understanding of statistical significance for feature engineering also create data visualizatoin of statistically signifiant features create baseline models for iterative improvements using recall as the scoring metric select best perfomring model and crate final prediction for model performance analysis compare feature weights and ranks among the best performing model to determine significant indicators of readmission prediction exploratory data analysis the predictant readmitted displays class imbalance with no readmission dominating the class followed by greater 30 days then less than 30 days some graph about data spread the age category of patients were skewed towards the older 50 patients some of the significant features of readmission predictions were following the probability of readmission was directly related to the number of diagnoses of the patient during the visit the number of inpatient visits were a significant factor in determining readmission possibilities model evaluation decision tree and random forest models were selected for modeling for their out of the box performance and heavy presence of categorical data both models were hypertuned with grid search cross validation method which increase model performance and decreased overfitting recall metric was selected as scoring method to reduce false negatives because it is better for care providers to be over prepared than caught unawares d the decision tree model was hypertuned second time with only features with significant importance decision tree sf from the first hypertuning this model saw great improvements in performance compared to the first model random forest model performed best overall and was selected as the recommended model for care provider usage the random forest model predicted each class proportionally to their class presence the greatest error was predicting 30 class as not readmitted class summary care providers can utilize the random forest model to predict future readmission possibility of a patient this will allow the hosptials to idenify high risk patients and predict readmission patient count to plan treatment and logistic necessities accordingly all features indentified in eda process were ranked high in feature importance of all models number of inpatients visits diagnoses and medication were among the highest in all models it is recommeded that care providers also utilize these metrics in determining patient care future steps create more

hackathon can be found here the dataset and descriptions can be found here or in the folder data this our team page teammates jiajun he zelin li an outline of our work and result can be found in the file presentation_slides pdf a more detailed description is shown below an outline of our work train a model on synthetic data to predict re admission of the patients compare the performance on synthetic data and real data train a neuron net to classify real data and synthetic data analyze the result of the last step find the most significant difference between two datasets detailed description of each step 1 train a model to predict re admission of the patient train a model on synthetic data to predict re admission of the patients then valid on validation set of synthetic data and on real data compare the difference in performance to find if there is any difference between real data and syn data 1 1 pca by pca we reduce 41 dimensions except readmit to 10 dimensions then calculate the correlation coefficient between each principle component and each raw dimensions find that there are some dimensions that are very un related with all those 10 principle components they are chlorpropamide acetohexamide tolbutamide miglitol tolazamide glyburide metformin glipizide metformin so in all of the following analysis we teased out these dimensions 1 2 model structure the structure during training is shown as follows when predicting use discrete fratures by random forest2 to classify and use continuous features by neuron network to further classify those data being predicted as class 1 1 3 result synthetic data training set synthetic data val set real data accuracy 71 68 53 from the table we find that real data is much harder to predict than synthetic data so only using synthetic data to conduct data analysis is risky 2 classify real data and synthetic data last step we find that there are significant difference between 2 dataset so in this step we want to figure out if this difference is learnable by training a classifier to classify 2 dataset 2 1 model structure we use a 5 hidden layer neuron network to classify and the amount of neurons in each layer is 60 40 20 10 5 2 2 result training set val set accuracy 90 88 from the table we can tell that the difference between 2 datasets is learnable 3 analysis the result find the most significant difference between 2 datasets in last step we find that the difference between 2 datasets is learnable in this step we use t sne to visualise the ability of decoupling of each layer in our trained neuron network 3 1 t sne embedding and visualization from the picture we can see after 1st layer the decoupling is pretty good though as network goes deeper the result is getting better what makes a significant difference is 1st layer 3 2 analyse what the 1st layer does to see what the 1st layer does we take pseudo inverse to recoover input this inspiration comes from the paper visualizing and understanding convolutional networks by zeiler m d fergus r in 2014 though this is not a convnet the idea is similar we take the samples that mostly active the neurons in 1st layer the matrix of these samples are x a is the outout of 1st layer then we use formula below to recover x here we take pseudo inv as w is not square then compare the difference between input and input x check those dimensions significantly negative in recovered x these dimensions can be interepreted as useless dimensions beacuse 1st layers are not activated by these dimensions by teasing these dimensions out we get 22 dimensions remained 3 3 find the most important dimensions amoung 22 dimensions first train model to classify real and syn data using only 1 dimension of these 22 dimensions finding the accuracy are just a little bit higher than 50 indecating that one dimension is not sufficient second train model by using 2 dimensions of these 22 dimensions finding by combining insulin and diabetesmed insulin and change change and diabetesmed the accuracy can achieve about 62 65 while the combination of other dimensions seem no use then we train model by using these 3 dimensions insulin change and diabetesmed the accuracy is shown below all features only 3 features all other features accuracy 88 72 74 this indecates that these 3 features really matter 3 4 understand why these 3 features matter we calculate the correlation coefficient between these 3 features the result is shown as follow real data insulin change diabetesmed insulin 1 00 0 14 0 26 change 0 14 1 00 0 51 diabetesmed 0 26 0 51 1 00 synthetic data insulin change diabetesmed insulin 1 00 0 02 0 01 change 0 02 1 00 0 02 diabetesmed 0 01 0 02 1 00 in real data these three dimensions are highly related while in synthetic data these three dimensions seems to be generated independently this is the most significant difference between 2 datasets 4 conclusion the mainly difference between real data and synthetic data are dimensions insulin change and diabetesmed in real data these three dimensions are highly related while in synthetic data these three dimensions seems to be generated independently

and the social factors of life on the prevalence of obesity and diabetes the american lifestyle and disease prevalence 2021 team are excited to share their interactive heroku app which will give you the answer https diet habits disease us herokuapp com table of contents project description approach data sets etl requirements languages and libraries dashboard plots leaflet map data analysis linear regression limitations collaborators conclusion take away and future direction project description overview the united states has a diverse population in terms of demographics socioeconomic status ses lifestyle and living conditions these factors play a role in the general health of each person and potentially contribute to subsequent risk of disease in particular diabetes and obesity cause a significant social and economic burden on the united states however the role of certain modifying factors in their prevalence remains unclear the centers for disease control and prevention cdc have indicated that diabetes increased from 9 5 during 1999 to 2002 to 12 during 2013 to 2016 moreover epidemiological data suggests its prevalence varied based on race ses and other factors on the other hand the rate of obesity increased from 30 5 to 42 4 during the same periods and also showed variability based on several factors diet is one of the most important determinants of health which is impacted by numerous factors availability of healthy foods access to healthy foods or the resources to consume a regular healthy diet vary greatly across the united states disparate social factors like household income may play a crucial role education level and employment play an important part in dietary choices comprehensive analysis of current data on diet demographics and lifestyle in the united states is lacking especially a close examination of specific factors that shed light on why certain americans are predisposed to developing diabetes and or obesity objectives the goal of this project was to examine the dietary habits of americans and assess whether access to food choice of diet socioeconomic status and other factors contribute to the development of diabetes and obesity presented here is a state by state analysis of dietary trends using the food environment index access to healthy food household income by race education level and exercise habits furthermore the relationship between these factors and the prevalence of diabetes and obesity are depicted across the country and clearly show specific positive associations that are indicative of causality map based data visualization is provided for more focused insight and can be used for subsequent analyses approach for this project we used data from the datasets below and performed an etl pipeline using the languages listed data sets food environment atlas county health rankings roadmaps etl extract transform load data investigation investigated the datasets and realized that data had to be scraped from 560 different excel workbooks which would be too cumbersome to download manually so we decided to write a script to scrape the data from the webpages extract developed a script to web scrape only the relevant data and categories in 559 excel workbooks from the county health rankings and roadmaps website script also extracted relevant data from two worksheets restaurants and local in food environment atlas workbook data for each factor was not available for all years and there were differences in column names for these factors in different excel sheets excel sheets for alaska and lousiana for the year 2020 alone had county column titled as borough and parish resp so the extraction script had to handle these inconsistencies appropriately to fetch all data transform consolidated the data collected from both the data sources into one data frame cleaned the data and renamed the columns load loaded the web scraped data into an excel file and remote mongodb for further analysis requirements languages and libraries the following is a list of the required languages modules and libraries that we used for a more detailed list of all modules and libraries that we installed in our project environment please see the project requirements file jupyter notebook python pandas matplotlib library flask api html mongodb javascript d3 js dom manipulation plotly js leaflet js choropleth jquery css bootstrap json dashboard to present our data we created an interactive dashboard that included various plots that are user friendly and interactive for optimum visualization of the data the plots below show the trends for the prevelance of obesity and diabetes and the following factors 1 percent limited access to healthy foods 2 food environment index fei 3 percent physically inactive 4

a leaflet map was developed to show the distribution and occurrence rates of the factors being examined state by state across the country data analysis linear regression analysis was performed to determine if there was an association between obesity and diabetes and the factors listed above linear regression linear regression analyses were performed to determine if there was an association between several factors and the prevalence of obesity and diabetes this analysis was performed to determine the relationship between several independent variables like access to healthy foods and the dependent variables obesity and diabetes limitations data was not available for all years for all of the factors analyzed the food environment atlas only had data for 2007 and 2012 and nothing more current than that not all of the years could be included in the datasets because the columns were not consistently constructed from year to year and in some cases data was inconsistent direct farm sales per capita change 2007 12 could not be used for analysis due to lack of obesity diabetes rate data for years 2007 through 2009 the following columns were not used for analysis due to the inaccuracy of data readings in the county health rankings roadmaps primary care physicians rate primary care physicians mental health providers mental health provider rate collaborators conclusion dietary trends in the united states over the last decade provide insight into the general health and well being of americans in addition the foods americans eat and their lifestyle choices determine the prevalence of certain chronic diseases like obesity and type 2 diabetes unfortunately some lifestyle choices are determined by socioeconomic status and availability of resources which are disparate and uneven throughout the country although there is plenty of data on the effects of diet on the incidence of obesity and diabetes far less is known about the impacts of other modifying factors like education or income factors that are associated with disease prevalence limited access to healthy foods varied from state to state and even within a state and it appears that less access to healthy foods might contribute to obesity rates but not diabetes across the country the food environmental index which indicates the quality of food in a given place was weakly associated with the degree of disease the percentage of physical inactivity or the number of americans who do not engage in leisure time exercise directly contributed to both obesity and diabetes over the last ten years especially the latter with which there is a strong positive association median family income which varied starkly across the united states had a moderate negative association with both obesity and diabetes suggesting household earning might determine other health related factors like what foods are eaten and other lifestyle choices factors that are not associated with disease prevalence there was no link for disease prevalence with education level nor with income ratio i e the separation between high and low income or unemployment rates there were no income related effects based on race take away and future direction the research presented here shows that certain factors i e lifestyle demographic socioeconomic play a major role in the prevalence of obesity and diabetes both in terms of the choices americans make in their personal lives and the social conditions of where they live among the lifestyle choices examined lack of exercise had the strongest consistent association with disease rates over ten years this may have been due to reduced availability of physical activity facilities on the other hand decreased local access to healthy food and household income were the most important contributors to disease prevalence in terms of demographic and socioeconomic factors respectively thus a combination of personal and social factors likely contribute to the number of people who develop these chronic conditions these associations should be considered over several years and carefully weighed for significance given the cause of chronic conditions like obesity and diabetes is multifactorial future work should examine the role of specific nutrition choices e g what americans buy at grocery stores heredity of disease i e does someone in the family already have it and

New Delhi,5,10,1,145, prediction diabetes readmission diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder in which prevalence has been increasing steadily all over the world as a result of this trend it is fast becoming an epidemic in some countries of the world the number of people affected is expected to double in the next decade due to an increase in the ageing population they are thereby adding to the already existing burden of hospital management especially in poorly developed countries this project is our contribution to the doctors and hospital management in these difficult times covid the purpose of this study is to classify the patients by proposing a machine learning model to classify that a patient will be readmitted within 30 days or not this model will include risk factors like age race gender etc dataset description in a broader sense the goal of this study is to help the hospital management by providing them with a reasonable estimate of whether a patient will be readmitted or not so our research will help to increase the quality of care and will increase efficiency and reduce the burden of the hospital management staff to run and apply techniques on dataset ipython file is attached main ipynb introduction given the data of patients suffering from diabetes mellitus we want to propose a model to predict that the patients admitted once will be readmitted again within 30 days period or not dataset there are 50 features present in the dataset out of 50 24 marks the dosage of medications like metformin glipizide etc and the remaining 26 included features like age gender weight time in the hospital etc the 24 features which were marking the dosage of medications can possess four different types of values up increase dosage down decrease dosage steady same dosage and no drug not prescribed the feature age was present in 10 groups showing the age groups like 0 10 10 20 etc and 66 2 of the total dataset population were older than 60 the feature race consisted of values like african american caucasian 74 7 of the entire dataset population other and also there were some missing values the feature readmission rate consisted of three types of values no 30 days and 30 days there were also the results of the a1c test were shown which is a preliminary test for diabetes mellitus and there were many more features which can be looked upon in the given uci machine learning repository preprocessing firstly it was identified which features have missing values there were seven such features out of these weight payer code medical speciality had the majority of values missing so these features were dropped for other features the corresponding rows with missing values were dropped after this step 94 of the data was retained the majority of features had string values so they were converted to discrete integer values feature creation a new feature was synthesized named service taken this feature was the sum of the columns number outpatient number inpatient and number emergency this feature summarised the comprehensive services utilized by the patient before being admitted to the hospital for the first time the features service taken number outpatient number inpatient number emergency had a lot of skewness to overcome this the log transform was applied to these features this helped in synthesizing the next feature some of the features were multiplied with each other to find a better relationship between them some of these are num of medications time in hospital age num of diagnoses outlier removal the dataset included multiple occurrences of a single patient 3 6 for each patient the subsequent data has been removed the reason behind this being characteristic of the patient might change in terms of lifestyle age health etc which can affect the data the data on which log transformations was applied have also been standardized feature encoding the dataset included features like race gender admission type id discharge disposition id admission source id max gluserum a1c result level1 diag1 which can be divided into classes so we used one hot encoding to encode them feature selection several techniques including anova were tested to perform feature selection the initial test using logistic regression and regularization technique coefficient s p values appeared to drop highly significant features from a medical perspective hence the random forest feature selection was performed the variable importance was then computed during 48 iterations a total of 25 predictors were thus selected after 48 iterations evaluation metric since we divided the dataset into three groups based on the age of the patient we decided different evaluation metrics for each of them for data corresponding to age group 0 30 and 30 70 mcc score was a sufficient measure to determine the best classifier along with these other metrics like precision recall f1 score were also taken into consideration those classifiers which were giving excellent accuracy but performed poorly on other metrics were not chosen for data corresponding to age group 70 100 we focused more on having low false negativity the reason for the following being that this group denotes the senior citizens if the classifier predicts the patient doesn t need to be readmitted within 30 days but actually the patient had to be readmitted this can lead to loss of life which is a severe consequence the model with decent accuracy and the comparatively low false negativity high mcc score was chosen in this case ,https://github.com/samarth1107,"Updated Dec 18, 2020"

Russas,13,11,11,220, testes de algoritmos de classificação na base de dados pima indians diabetes 1 introdução algoritmos de classificação são utilizados para mapear elementos semelhantes em categorias específicas neste trabalho serão abordados os seguintes algoritmos knn random forest naive bayes decision tree e perceptron cujos testes foram feitos na plataforma jupyter notebook e a classificação individual de cada classificador fora feita baseada na sua acurácia 2 descrição de experimentos 2 1 base de dados a base de dados escolhida para os experimentos é a pima indians diabetes que é composta por informações referentes a mulheres com pelo menos 21 anos de idade cuja origem é indígena dos povos pima nela estão inseridas 768 instâncias número de linhas com 9 atributos cada sendo que o último informa se a pessoa possui a doença ou não todos os atributos são preenchidos com valor numérico e correspondem a número de vezes que a pessoa ficou grávida preg concentração de glicose no plasma em um período de duas horas em um teste oral de tolerância à glicose plas pressão arterial diastólica mm hg pres espessura da dobra da pele do tríceps mm skin insulina sérica de 2 horas mu u ml test índice de massa corporal mass histórico de diabetes na família pedi idade age situação 0 não possui a doença 1 possui a doença class 2 2 algoritmos de classificação classificação é um método que aprende uma função em termos matemáticos com valores de atributos em seu domínio e valores de classe em sua imagem em outras palavras dado um conjunto de valores de atributos tal função determina um valor de classe para esse conjunto essa função é também conhecida como modelo de classificação silva 2007 essa classificação é feita através de algoritmos de aprendizagem esses algoritmos conseguem criar conhecimento sobre o domínio tratado através de dados de entrada quando esses dados de entrada já possuem suas classes atribuídas dizemos que essa é uma aprendizagem supervisionada dessa forma o algoritmo consegue criar uma relação entre as características de cada entrada com a sua classe final gerando um conhecimento para fazer previsões sobre entradas que ainda não possuem uma classe definida esses dados de entrada já classificados são chamados de base de treino enquanto que os documentos que serão classificados posteriormente ao treino são denominados como a base de teste santos 2013 quando a base de treino não possui uma classificação pré definida são utilizados algoritmos de aprendizagem não supervisionada nesse caso os algoritmos tentam agrupar entradas com características semelhantes e classificá los por grupos esse tipo de classificação é chamada de clusterização santos 2013 2 2 1 random forest o algoritmo random forest trata se de um classificador que faz uso do método de árvores de decisão criada por breiman 2001 possibilitando a mineração dos dados esta técnica possui uma ideia um pouco diferente dos algoritmos de árvores de decisão enquanto uma árvore possui o objetivo de construção total de uma estrutura a partir de uma base de dados o random forest tem o objetivo de efetuar a criação de várias árvores de decisão usando um subconjunto de atributos selecionados aleatoriamente a partir do conjunto original contendo todos os atributos e que estes possuem um tipo de amostragem chamado de bootstrap a qual é do tipo com reposição possibilitando assim melhor análise dos dados neto 2014 figura 1 uso do algoritmo random forest 2 2 2 knn o algoritmo k nearest neighbor knn é um algoritmo de aprendizado supervisionado do tipo lazy a ideia geral desse algoritmo consiste em encontrar os k exemplos rotulados mais próximos do exemplo não classificado e com base no rótulo desses exemplos mais próximos é tomada a decisão relativa à classe do exemplo não rotulado os algoritmos da família knn requerem pouco esforço durante a etapa de treinamento em contrapartida o custo computacional para rotular um novo exemplo é relativamente alto pois no pior dos casos esse exemplo será comparado com todos os exemplos contidos no conjunto de treinamento ferrero 2009 figura 2 uso do algoritmo knn 2 2 3 decision tree o algoritmo decision tree ou árvore de decisão é uma representação simples de um classificador utilizada por diversos sistemas de aprendizado de máquina uma árvore de decisão é induzida a partir de um conjunto de exemplos de treinamento onde as classes são previamente conhecidas a estrutura da árvore é organizada de tal forma que a tcada nó interno não folha é rotulado com o nome de um dos atributos previsores b tos ramos ou arestas saindo de um nó interno são rotulados com valores do atributo naquele nó c tcada folha é rotulada com uma classe a qual é a classe prevista para exemplos que pertençam àquele nó folha o processo de classificação de um exemplo ocorre fazendo aquele exemplo caminhar pela árvore a partir do nó raiz procurando percorrer os arcos que unem os nós de acordo com as condições que estes mesmos arcos representam ao atingir um nó folha a classe que rotula aquele nó folha é atribuída àquele exemplo carvalho 2005 figura 3 uso do algoritmo decision tree 2 2 4 naive bayes o algoritmo naive bayes é um classificador probabilístico simples que calcula um conjunto de probabilidades contando a frequência e as combinações de valores em um determinado conjunto de dados o algoritmo usa o teorema de bayes e assume que todos os atributos são independentes dado o valor da variável de classe essa suposição de independência condicional raramente é verdadeira em aplicações do mundo real daí a caracterização como ingênua mas o algoritmo tende a ter um bom desempenho e aprender rapidamente em vários problemas de classificação supervisionada essa ingenuidade permite que o algoritmo construa facilmente classificações a partir de grandes conjuntos de dados sem recorrer a esquemas de estimativa de parâmetros iterativos complicados dimitoglou adams jim 2012 figura 4 uso do algoritmo naive bayes 2 2 5 perceptron o perceptron consiste em uma única camada de neurônios com pesos sinápticos e bias ajustáveis se os padrões de entrada forem linearmente separáveis o algoritmo de treinamento do perceptron possui convergência garantida ou seja é capaz de encontrar um conjunto de pesos que classifica corretamente os dados os pesos dos neurônios que compõem o perceptron serão tais que as superfícies de decisão produzidas pela rede neural estarão apropriadamente posicionadas no espaço castro f castro m 2001 figura 5 uso do algoritmo perceptron 3 resultados como resultado obtido observa
