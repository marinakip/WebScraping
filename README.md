This repository contains my diploma thesis at the Computer Science Department, University of Ioannina, Greece

This thesis has a target of creating a recommendation system using GitHub 's data with geo visualization of results. It offers the user the opportunity to search information 
about GitHubâ€™s repositories along with statistics about its users and their contribution and impact to the software community. Also, it offers some more precise information 
after intelligent clustering of the results taking into account their geographical locations and gives the user a clearer idea about the software contributions on a global scale.
For the clustering of the results, machine learning algorithms were used like K-means and Mean Shift while the geographical representation of the results was achieved with the
help of Open Street Maps after geocoding the addresses of the users.
